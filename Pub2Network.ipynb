            "Point mutations in the catalytic domain disrupt cellulose synthase (CESA6) vesicle trafficking and protein dynamics.\n",
            "Cellulose, the main component of the plant cell wall, is synthesized by the  multimeric cellulose synthase (CESA) complex (CSC). In plant cells, CSCs are  assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi and transported through the  endomembrane system to the plasma membrane (PM). However, how CESA catalytic  activity or conserved motifs around the catalytic core influence vesicle  trafficking or protein dynamics is not well understood. Here, we used yellow  fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged AtCESA6 and created 18 mutants in key motifs of  the catalytic domain to analyze how they affected seedling growth, cellulose  biosynthesis, complex formation, and CSC dynamics and trafficking in Arabidopsis  thaliana. Seedling growth and cellulose content were reduced by nearly all  mutations. Moreover, mutations in most conserved motifs slowed CSC movement in  the PM as well as delivery of CSCs to the PM. Interestingly, mutations in the DDG  and QXXRW motifs affected YFP-CESA6 abundance in the Golgi. These mutations also  perturbed post-Golgi trafficking of CSCs. The 18 mutations were divided into two  groups based on their phenotypes; we propose that Group I mutations cause CSC  trafficking defects whereas Group II mutations, especially in the QXXRW motif,  affect protein folding and/or CSC rosette formation. Collectively, our results  demonstrate that the CESA6 catalytic domain is essential for cellulose  biosynthesis as well as CSC formation, protein folding and dynamics, and vesicle  trafficking.\n",

            "Xylan is a hemicellulose present in the cell walls of all land plants.  Glycosyltransferases of the GT43 (IRX9/IRX9L and IRX14/IRX14L) and GT47  (IRX10/IRX10L) families are involved in the biosynthesis of its beta-1,4-linked  xylose backbone, which can be further modified by acetylation and sugar side  chains. However, it remains unclear how the different enzymes work together to  synthesize the xylan backbone. A xylan synthesis complex (XSC) has been described  in the monocots wheat and asparagus, and co-expression of asparagus AoIRX9,  AoIRX10 and AoIRX14A is required to form a catalytically active complex for  secondary cell wall xylan biosynthesis. Here, we argue that an equivalent XSC  exists for the synthesis of the primary cell wall of the eudicot Arabidopsis  thaliana, consisting of IRX9L, IRX10L and IRX14. This would suggest the existence  of distinct XSCs for primary and secondary cell wall xylan synthesis, reminiscent  of the distinct cellulose synthesis complexes (CSCs) of the primary and secondary  cell wall. In contrast to the CSC, in which each CESA protein has catalytic  activity, the XSC seems to contain proteins with non-catalytic function with each  component bearing potentially unique but crucial roles. Moreover, the core XSC  formed by a combination of IRX9/IRX9L, IRX10/IRX10L and IRX14/IRX14L might not be  stable in its composition during transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the  Golgi apparatus. Instead, potential dynamic changes of the XSC might be a means  of regulating xylan biosynthesis to facilitate coordinated deposition of tailored  polysaccharides in the plant cell wall.\n",

            "The Plant-Conserved Region (P-CR) and the Class-Specific Region (CSR) are two  plant-unique sequences in the catalytic core of cellulose synthases (CESAs) for  which specific functions have not been established. Here, we used site-directed  mutagenesis to replace amino acids and motifs within these sequences predicted to  be essential for assembly and function of CESAs. We developed an in vivo method  to determine the ability of mutated CesA1 transgenes to complement an Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) temperature-sensitive root-swelling1 (rsw1) mutant.  Replacement of a Cys residue in the CSR, which blocks dimerization in vitro,  rendered the AtCesA1 transgene unable to complement the rsw1 mutation.  Examination of the CSR sequences from 33 diverse angiosperm species showed  domains of high-sequence conservation in a class-specific manner but with  variation in the degrees of disorder, indicating a nonredundant role of the CSR  structures in different CESA isoform classes. The Cys residue essential for  dimerization was not always located in domains of intrinsic disorder. Expression  of AtCesA1 transgene constructs, in which Pro417 and Arg453 were substituted for  Ala or Lys in the coiled-coil of the P-CR, were also unable to complement the  rsw1 mutation. Despite an expected role for Arg457 in trimerization of CESA  proteins, AtCesA1 transgenes with Arg457Ala mutations were able to fully restore  the wild-type phenotype in rsw1. Our data support that Cys662 within the CSR and  Pro417 and Arg453 within the P-CR of Arabidopsis CESA1 are essential residues for  functional synthase complex formation, but our data do not support a specific  role for Arg457 in trimerization in native CESA complexes.\n",

            "Plants have evolved signaling mechanisms that guide growth away from adverse  environments that can cause yield losses. Root halotropism is a sodium-specific  negative tropism that is crucial for surviving and thriving under high salinity.  Although root halotropism was discovered some years ago, the underlying molecular  and cellular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that abscisic acid  (ABA)-mediated root twisting determines halotropism in Arabidopsis. An  ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinase (SnRK2.6) phosphorylates the  microtubule-associated protein SP2L at Ser406, which induces a change in the  anisotropic cell expansion at the root transition zone and is required for root  twisting during halotropism. Salt stress triggers SP2L-mediated cortical  microtubule reorientation, which guides cellulose microfibril patterns. Our  findings thus outline the molecular mechanism of root halotropism and indicate  that anisotropic cell expansion through microtubule reorientation and microfibril  deposition has a central role in mediating tropic responses.\n",

            "The cellulose synthase gene superfamily contains cellulose synthase (CesA) and  cellulose synthase-like (Csl) gene families, which synthesize cellulose and  hemicellulose in plant cell walls and play a crucial role in plant growth and  development. However, the CesA/Csl gene family has not been reported in pepper.  Therefore, the genome-wide research of the CaCesA/CaCsl gene family was conducted  in pepper. In this study, a total of 39 CaCesA/CaCsls genes (10 CesAs genes and  29 Csls genes) were identified in pepper and unevenly distributed on 11  chromosomes. These CaCesA/Csls were divided into seven subfamilies (CesAs, CslAs,  CslBs, CslCs, CslDs, CslEs, CslGs), and most of CaCesA/Csls genes are closely  related to AtCesA/Csls genes. The cis-acting elements in the promoters of  CaCesA/Csls genes are mainly related to hormone response and stress response.  There are ten collinear gene pairs between the CesA/Csls gene family of pepper  and Arabidopsis, and four fragment duplication gene pairs of the CaCesA/Csls  genes were discovered. RNA-seq analysis shows that the majority of CaCesA/Csls  are expressed in a variety of plant tissues, indicating that most CaCesA/Csls  gene expression patterns are not organ-specific, and CaCslD1/D4 have the highest  expression in anthers, followed by petal, ovary, and F9. RNA-seq analysis shows  that most CaCesA/Csls are responsive to five hormones (IAA, GA(3), ABA, SA, and  MeJA). The tissue-specific expression analysis of the CaCslD1 gene shows that the  CaCslD1 gene is expressed specifically in flowers. In the flower buds IV of  cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and its restoration of fertility (Rf) system,  CaCslD1 reach the highest expression respectively. However, the relative  expression level of CaCslD1 in the fertile accessions is extremely significantly  higher than in the sterile accessions. This study shows an overall understanding  of the CaCesA/Csls gene family and provides a new insight for understanding the  function of CaCslD1 in pollen development and exploring the fertility restoration  of CMS in pepper.\n",

S-acylation is a reversible  post-translational lipid modification of proteins catalyzed by protein S-acyl  transferases (PATs). S-acylation is important for various biological molecular  mechanisms including cellulose biosynthesis. Cellulose is synthesized by the  cellulose synthase A (CESA) complexes (CSCs) at the plasma membrane. However,  specific PAT involving in cellulose biosynthesis has not been identified and the  precise mechanism by which PAT regulates the CESAs is largely unknown. Here, we  report isolation of tip1-5, an allele of Tip Growth Defective1 (AtTIP1/AtPAT24)  with a premature stop codon. tip1-5 genetically interacts with ixr1-2, a point  mutant of AtCESA3 which encodes a catalytic subunit of CSC synthesizing primary  wall cellulose. We show that AtTIP1 physically interacts with AtCESA3. AtCESA3  undergoes S-acylation, which is possibly mediated by AtTIP1, suggesting a  functional relationship between AtTIP1 and AtCESA3. Moreover, the interfascicular  fiber cells in the primary inflorescence stems of tip1-5 ixr1-2 double mutant  contain thinner cell walls and significantly less crystalline cellulose compared  to the single mutants.

R2R3-MYB transcription factors play  important roles in regulation secondary cell wall (SCW) formation. However, there  are few reports on the functions of MYB transcription factors which involved in  both primary cell wall (PCW) and SCW formation. Here, we isolated an R2R3-MYB  transcription factor, PnMYB2, from Panax notoginseng roots which are widely used  in Chinese traditional medicines and contain abundant cellulose and lignin. The  expression pattern of PnMYB2 was similar to the accumulation pattern of cellulose  and lignin contents in different organs. PnMYB2 localized in the nucleus and may  function as a transcriptional activator. Overexpression of PnMYB2 in Arabidopsis  thaliana enhanced cellulose and lignin biosynthesis, and remarkably increased  thickness of PCW and SCW in the stem of transgenic plants compared with wild-type  plants. The expression levels of genes associated with PCW-specific cellulose  synthase (CesA) genes and key SCW-specific lignin biosynthetic genes were  significantly increased in PnMYB2-overexpressing plants compared to the wild type  plants. Furthermore, yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase reporter assays and  electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) results verified that PnMYB2 could  bind and activate the promoters of AtCesA3 and PnCesA3, which are the  PCW-specific cellulose biosynthetic genes, and AtCCoAOMT1 and PnCCoAOMT1, which  are the key lignin biosynthetic genes.

They are related to the cellulose synthase (CesA) genes  involved in cellulose biosynthesis, and the CslD genes that influence root hair  development. Although CslD genes are implicated in callose, mannan and cellulose  biosynthesis, and are found in both monocots and eudicots, CslF genes are  specific to the Poaceae. Recently the barley CslF3 (HvCslF3) gene was shown to be  involved in the synthesis of a novel (1,4)-beta-linked glucoxylan, but it remains  unclear whether this gene contributes to plant growth and development. Here,  expression profiling using qRT-PCR and mRNA in situ hybridization revealed that  HvCslF3 accumulates in the root elongation zone. Silencing HvCslF3 by RNAi was  accompanied by slower root growth, linked with a shorter elongation zone and a  significant reduction in root system size. Polymer profiling of the RNAi lines  revealed a significant reduction in (1,4)-beta-linked glucoxylan levels. Remarkably,  the heterologous expression of HvCslF3 in wild-type (Col-0) and root  hair-deficient Arabidopsis mutants (csld3 and csld5) complemented the csld5  mutant phenotype, in addition to altering epidermal cell fate.

In this study, we report  that in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibers harvested during secondary cell wall  (SCW) synthesis, GhCesA 4, 7, and 8 assembled into heteromers in a previously  uncharacterized 36-mer-like cellulose synthase supercomplex (CSS). This super CSC  was observed in samples prepared using cotton fiber cells harvested during the  SCW synthesis period but not from cotton stem tissue or any samples obtained from  Arabidopsis. Knock-out of any of GhCesA 4, 7, and 8 resulted in the disappearance  of the CSS and the production of fiber cells with no SCW thickening. Cotton fiber  CSS showed significantly higher enzyme activity than samples prepared from  knock-out cotton lines. We found that the microfibrils from the SCW of wild-type  cotton fibers may contain 72 glucan chains in a bundle, unlike other plant  materials studied. GhCesA4, 7, and 8 restored both the dwarf and reduced vascular  bundle phenotypes of their orthologous Arabidopsis mutants, potentially by  reforming the CSC hexamers. Genetic complementation was not observed when  non-orthologous CesA genes were used, indicating that each of the three subunits  is indispensable for CSC formation and for full cellulose synthase function.

Single and double cage mutants also show increased  sensitivity to the cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor isoxaben. The cage1cage2  phenotypes were associated with an approximately 30% reduction in cellulose  content, an approximately 50% reduction in secondary cell wall CELLULOSE SYNTHASE  (CESA) protein levels in stems and reduced cellulose biosynthesis rate in  seedlings. CESA transcript levels were not significantly altered in cage1cage2  mutants, suggesting that the reduction in CESA levels was caused by a  post-transcriptional mechanism. Both CAGE1 and 2 localize to the Golgi apparatus  and are predicted to synthesize beta-1,3-galactans on arabinogalactan proteins. In  line with this, the cage1cage2 mutants exhibit reduced levels of beta-Yariv binding  to arabinogalactan protein linked beta-1,3-galactan.

            "In plants, secretion of cell wall components and membrane proteins plays a  fundamental role in growth and development as well as survival in diverse  environments. Exocytosis, as the last step of the secretory trafficking pathway,  is a highly ordered and precisely controlled process involving tethering,  docking, and fusion of vesicles at the plasma membrane (PM) for cargo delivery.  Although the exocytic process and machinery are well characterized in yeast and  animal models, the molecular players and specific molecular events that underpin  late stages of exocytosis in plant cells remain largely unknown. Here, by using  the delivery of functional, fluorescent-tagged cellulose synthase (CESA)  complexes (CSCs) to the PM as a model system for secretion, as well as  single-particle tracking in living cells, we describe a quantitative approach for  measuring the frequency of vesicle tethering events. Genetic and pharmacological  inhibition of cytoskeletal function, reveal that the initial vesicle tethering  step of exocytosis is dependent on actin and myosin XI. In contrast, treatments  with the microtubule inhibitor, oryzalin, did not significantly affect vesicle  tethering or fusion during CSC exocytosis but caused a minor increase in  transient or aborted tethering events. With data from this new quantitative  approach and improved spatiotemporal resolution of single particle events during  secretion, we generate a revised model for the role of the cortical cytoskeleton  in CSC trafficking.\n",

Here, we applied Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM),  which improves resolution two-fold over confocal or widefield imaging, to explore  the dynamic behaviors of CESA particles in living plant cells. SIM imaging  reveals that Arabidopsis thaliana CESA particles are more than twice as dense in  the plasma membrane as previously estimated, helping explain the dense  arrangement of cellulose observed in new wall layers. CESA particles tracked by  SIM display minimal variation in velocity, suggesting coordinated control of CESA  catalytic activity within single complexes and that CESA complexes might move  steadily in tandem to generate larger cellulose fibrils or bundles. SIM data also  reveal that CESA particles vary in their overlaps with microtubule tracks and can  complete U-turns without changing speed. CESA track patterns can vary widely  between neighboring cells of similar shape, implying that cellulose patterning is  not the sole determinant of cellular growth anisotropy. Together, these findings  highlight SIM as a powerful tool to advance CESA imaging beyond the resolution  limit of conventional light microscopy.\n",

            "In land plants and algae, cellulose is important for strengthening cell walls and  preventing breakage due to physical forces. Though our understanding of cellulose  production by cellulose synthases (CESAs) has seen significant advances for  several land plant and bacterial species, functional characterization of this  fundamental protein is absent in red algae. Here we identify CESA gene candidates  in the calcifying red alga Calliarthron tuberculosum using sequence  similarity-based approaches, and elucidate their phylogenetic relationship with  other CESAs from diverse taxa. One gene candidate, CtCESA1, was closely related  to other putative red algal CESA genes. To test if CtCESA1 encoded a true  cellulose synthase, CtCESA1 protein was expressed and purified from insect and  yeast expression systems. CtCESA1 showed glucan synthase activity in glucose  tracer assays. CtCESA1 activity was relatively low when compared with plant and  bacterial CESA activity. In an in vitro assay, a predicted N-terminal  starch-binding domain from CtCESA1 bound red algal floridean starch extracts,  representing a unique domain in red algal CESAs not present in CESAs from other  lineages. When the CtCESA1 gene was introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana cesa  mutants, the red algal CtCESA1 partially rescued the growth defects of the  primary cell wall cesa6 mutant, but not cesa3 or secondary cell wall cesa7  mutants. A fluorescently tagged CtCESA1 localized to the plasma membrane in the  Arabidopsis cesa6 mutant background. This study presents functional evidence  validating the sequence annotation of red algal CESAs. The relatively low  activity of CtCESA1, partial complementation in Arabidopsis, and presence of  unique protein domains suggest that there are probably functional differences  between the algal and land plant CESAs.\n",

Here, we report  results from mutant complementation assays that tested the ability of sequence  variants of AtCesA7, a secondary wall CesA of Arabidopsis thaliana, to rescue the  collapsed vessels, short stems, and low cellulose content of the irx3-1 AtCesA7  null mutant. We tested a catalytic null mutation and seven missense or small  domain changes in and near the AtCesA7 FTVTSK motif, which lies near the  catalytic domain and may, analogously to bacterial CesA, exist within a substrate  \"gating loop.\" A low-to-high gradient of rescue occurred, and even inactive  AtCesA7 had a small positive effect on stem cellulose content but not stem  elongation. Overall, secondary wall cellulose content and stem length were  moderately correlated, but the results were consistent with threshold amounts of  cellulose supporting particular developmental processes. Vibrational sum  frequency generation microscopy allowed tissue-specific analysis of cellulose  content in stem xylem and interfascicular fibers, revealing subtle differences  between selected genotypes that correlated with the extent of rescue of the  collapsing xylem phenotype. Similar tests on PpCesA5 from the moss Physcomitrium  (formerly Physcomitrella) patens helped us to synergize the AtCesA7 results with  prior results on AtCesA1 and PpCesA5. The cumulative results show that the FTVTxK  region is important for the function of an angiosperm secondary wall CesA as well  as widely divergent primary wall CesAs, while differences in complementation  results between isomers may reflect functional differences that can be explored  in further work.\n",

            "Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase (CESA)  complexes (CSCs), which are assembled in the Golgi and secreted to the plasma  membrane through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) compartment. However, the  molecular mechanisms that guide CSCs through the secretory system and deliver  them to the plasma membrane are poorly understood. Here, we identified an  uncharacterized gene, TRANVIA (TVA), that is transcriptionally coregulated with  the CESA genes required for primary cell wall synthesis. The tva mutant exhibits  enhanced sensitivity to cellulose synthesis inhibitors; reduced cellulose  content; and defective dynamics, density, and secretion of CSCs to the plasma  membrane as compared to wild type. TVA is a plant-specific protein of unknown  function that is detected in at least two different intracellular compartments:  organelles labeled by markers for the TGN and smaller compartments that deliver  CSCs to the plasma membrane. Together, our data suggest that TVA promotes  trafficking of CSCs to the plasma membrane by facilitating exit from the TGN  and/or interaction of CSC secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Cortical microtubules regulate cell expansion by determining  cellulose microfibril orientation in the root apex of Arabidopsis thaliana. While  the regulation of cell wall properties by cortical microtubules is well studied,  the data on the influence of cell wall to cortical microtubule organization and  stability remain scarce. Studies on cellulose biosynthesis mutants revealed that  cortical microtubules depend on Cellulose Synthase A (CESA) function and/or cell  expansion. Furthermore, it has been reported that cortical microtubules in  cellulose-deficient mutants are hypersensitive to oryzalin. In this work, the  persistence of cortical microtubules against anti-microtubule treatment was  thoroughly studied in the roots of several cesa mutants, namely thanatos, mre1,  any1, prc1-1 and rsw1, and the Cellulose Synthase Interacting 1 protein (csi1)  mutant pom2-4. In addition, various treatments with drugs affecting cell  expansion were performed on wild-type roots. Whole mount tubulin immunolabeling  was applied in the above roots and observations were performed by confocal  microscopy. RESULTS: Cortical microtubules in all mutants showed statistically  significant increased persistence against anti-microtubule drugs, compared to  those of the wild-type. Furthermore, to examine if the enhanced stability of  cortical microtubules was due to reduced cellulose biosynthesis or to suppression  of cell expansion, treatments of wild-type roots with 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile  (DCB) and Congo red were performed. After these treatments, cortical microtubules  appeared more resistant to oryzalin, than in the control. CONCLUSIONS: According  to these findings, it may be concluded that inhibition of cell expansion,  irrespective of the cause, results in increased microtubule stability in A.  thaliana root. In addition, cell expansion does not only rely on cortical  microtubule orientation but also plays a regulatory role in microtubule dynamics,  as well. Various hypotheses may explain the increased cortical microtubule  stability under decreased cell expansion such as the role of cell wall sensors  and the presence of less dynamic cortical microtubules.\n",

These transcription factors activate  expression of genes encoding PCW-type cellulose synthase (CESA) subunits and  other genes for PCW biosynthesis. In this study, we show that fiber-specific  expression of ERF035-VP16 and ERF041-VP16, which are VP16-fused proteins of  ERFIIId/e members, promote cell wall thickening in a wild-type background with a  concomitant increase of alcohol insoluble residues (cell wall content) per fresh  weight (FW) and monosaccharides related to the PCW without affecting plant  growth. Furthermore, in the ERF041-VP16 lines, the total amount of lignin and the  syringyl (S)/guaiacyl (G) ratio decreased, and the enzymatic saccharification  yield of glucose from cellulose per fresh weight improved. In these lines,  PCW-type CESA genes were upregulated and ferulate 5-hydropxylase1 (F5H1), which  is necessary for production of the S unit lignin, was downregulated. In addition,  various changes in the expression levels of transcription factors regulating  secondary cell wall (SCW) formation were observed. In conclusion, fiber  cell-specific ERF041-VP16 improves biomass yield, increases PCW components, and  alters lignin composition and deposition and may be suitable for use in future  molecular breeding programs of biomass crops.\n",

            "Cellulose is produced at the plasma membrane of plant cells by cellulose synthase  (CESA) complexes (CSCs). CSCs are assembled in the endomembrane system and then  trafficked to the plasma membrane. Because CESAs are only active in the plasma  membrane, control of CSC secretion regulates cellulose synthesis. We identified  members of a family of seven transmembrane domain-containing proteins (7TMs) that  are important for cellulose production during cell wall integrity stress. 7TMs  are often associated with guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein signaling and we  found that mutants affecting the Gbetagamma dimer phenocopied the 7tm mutants.  Unexpectedly, the 7TMs localized to the Golgi/trans-Golgi network where they  interacted with G protein components. Here, the 7TMs and Gbetagamma regulated CESA  trafficking but did not affect general protein secretion. Our results outline how  a G protein-coupled module regulates CESA trafficking and reveal that defects in  this process lead to exacerbated responses to cell wall integrity stress.\n",

            "Myosin motors are essential players in secretory vesicle trafficking and  exocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells; however, similar roles in plants remain  a matter for debate, at least for diffusely growing cells. Here, we demonstrate  that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) myosin XIK, via its globular tail domain  (GTD), participates in the vesicle tethering step of exocytosis through direct  interactions with the exocyst complex. Specifically, myosin XIK GTD bound  directly to several exocyst subunits in vitro and functional fluorescently tagged  XIK colocalized with multiple exocyst subunits at plasma membrane (PM)-associated  stationary foci. Moreover, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of myosin XI  activity reduced the rate of appearance and lifetime of stationary exocyst  complexes at the PM. By tracking single exocytosis events of cellulose synthase  (CESA) complexes with high spatiotemporal resolution imaging and pair-wise  colocalization of myosin XIK, exocyst subunits, and CESA6, we demonstrated that  XIK associates with secretory vesicles earlier than exocyst and is required for  the efficient localization and normal dynamic behavior of exocyst complex at the  PM tethering site. This study reveals an important functional role for myosin XI  in secretion and provides insights about the dynamic regulation of exocytosis in  plants.\n",

            "Endosidin20 (ES20) is a recently identified cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor  (CBI) that targets the catalytic site of plant cellulose synthase (CESA). Here,  we screened over 600 ES20 analogs and identified nine active analogs named ES20-1  to ES20-9. Among these, endosidin20-1 (ES20-1) had stronger inhibitory effects on  plant growth and cellulose biosynthesis than ES20. At the biochemical level, we  demonstrated that ES20-1, like ES20, directly interacts with CESA6. At the  cellular level, this molecule, like ES20, induced the accumulation of cellulose  synthase complexes at the Golgi apparatus and inhibited their secretion to the  plasma membrane. Like ES20, ES20-1 likely targets the catalytic site of CESA.  However, through molecular docking analysis using a modeled structure of  full-length CESA6, we found that both ES20 and ES20-1 might have another target  site at the transmembrane regions of CESA6. Besides ES20, other CBIs such as  isoxaben, C17, and flupoxam are widely used tools to dissect the mechanism of  cellulose biosynthesis and are also valuable resources for the development of  herbicides. Here, based on mutant genetic analysis and molecular docking  analysis, we have identified the potential target sites of these CBIs on a  modeled CESA structure. Some bacteria also produce cellulose, and both ES20 and  ES20-1 inhibited bacterial cellulose biosynthesis. Therefore, we conclude that  ES20-1 is a more potent analog of ES20 that inhibits intrinsic cellulose  biosynthesis in plants, and both ES20 and ES20-1 show an inhibitory effect on  bacterial growth and cellulose synthesis, making them excellent tools for  exploring the mechanisms of cellulose biosynthesis across kingdoms.\n",

By superimposing the structure of  AtCESA3(CatD) onto the bacterial cellulose synthase BcsA, we found that the  coordination of the UDP-Glc differs, indicating different substrate coordination  during cellulose synthesis in plants and bacteria. Moreover, structural analyses  revealed that AtCESA3(CatD) can form a homodimer mainly via interactions between  specific beta strands. We confirmed the importance of specific amino acids on  these strands for homodimerization through yeast and in planta assays using  point-mutated full-length AtCESA3.

A pectin defective mutant qua2, identified from screening  an Arabidopsis EMS mutant library, showed a reduced sensitivity to CWM treatment.  On the other hand, pectinase treatment suppressed the CWM induced phenotype.  Furthermore, cellulose content was decreased in response to CWM treatment, while  the cellulose synthesis mutants ixr1 and ixr2 were hypersensitive to CWM.

However, little is known about their function in pear fruit, a model  for Rosaceae species and for fleshy fruit development. In our research, a total  of 36 CesA/Csl family members were identified from the pear and were grouped into  six subfamilies (CesA, CslB, CslC, CslD, CslE, and CslG) according to  phylogenetic relationships. We performed a protein sequence physicochemical  analysis, phylogenetic tree construction, a gene structure, a conserved domain,  and chromosomal localization analysis. The results indicated that most of the  CesA/Csl genes from pear are closely related to genes in Arabidopsis, but these  families have unique characteristics in terms of their gene structure,  chromosomal localization, phylogeny, and deduced protein sequences, suggesting  that they have evolved through different processes. Tissue expression analysis  results showed that most of the CesA/Csl genes were constitutively expressed at  different levels in different organs.

We recently  reported a new CESA inhibitor named Endosidin20 (ES20) that targets the catalytic  site of CESA6 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We found that inhibiting  CESA catalytic activity by ES20 treatment reduces the motility of CSC at the  plasma membrane and reduces the delivery of CSC to the plasma membrane. We also  found that ES20 treatment causes an increased abundance of CSC at the Golgi.  Through further investigation, here we show that inhibiting CESA catalytic  activity by ES20 treatment does not interfere with the transport of CSC from  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, indicating that inhibiting CESA  catalytic activity reduces efficient CSC exit from Golgi. We also show that ES20  affects CSC trafficking without interfering with the trafficking of other cargo  proteins in the secretory pathway and does not disturb the cellular localization  of typical organelle marker proteins. In combination with our recent findings,  our results show that inhibiting CESA catalytic activity by short-term ES20  treatment affects CSC exit from Golgi and CSC post-Golgi transport but does not  affect CSC transport from ER to the Golgi.\n",

It has been proposed that the CESA6-like proteins occupy  the same position in the CSC, but their underlying selection mechanism remains  unclear. We produced a chimeric CESA5 by replacing its N-terminal zinc finger  with its CESA6 counterpart to investigate the consequences for its  homodimerization, a crucial step in forming higher-order structures during  assembly of the CSC. We found that the mutant phenotypes of prc1-1, a cesa6 null  mutant, were rescued by the chimeric CESA5, and became comparable to the wild  type (WT) and prc1-1 complemented by WT CESA6 in regard to plant growth,  cellulose content, cellulose microfibril organization, CSC dynamics and  subcellular localization. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays were  employed to evaluate pairwise interactions between the N-terminal regions of  CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA6 and the chimeric CESA5. We verified that the chimeric  CESA5 explicitly interacted with all the other CESA partners, comparable to  CESA6, whereas interaction between CESA5 with itself was significantly weaker  than that of all other CESA pairs. Our findings suggest that the homodimerization  of CESA6 through its N-terminal zinc finger is critical in defining its  functional properties, and possibly determines its intrinsic roles in  facilitating higher-order structures in CSCs.\n",

Each CSC is composed of multiple subunits of CESAs representing  three different isoforms. Individual CESA proteins contain conserved catalytic  domains for catalyzing cellulose synthesis, other domains such as plant-conserved  sequences, and class-specific regions that are thought to facilitate complex  assembly and CSC trafficking. Because of the current lack of atomic-resolution  structures for plant CSCs or CESAs, the molecular mechanism through which CESA  catalyzes cellulose synthesis and whether its catalytic activity influences  efficient CSC transport at the subcellular level remain unknown. Here, by  performing chemical genetic analyses, biochemical assays, structural modeling,  and molecular docking, we demonstrate that Endosidin20 (ES20) targets the  catalytic site of CESA6 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Chemical genetic  analysis revealed important amino acids that potentially participate in the  catalytic activity of plant CESA6, in addition to previously identified conserved  motifs across kingdoms. Using high spatiotemporal resolution live cell imaging,  we found that inhibiting the catalytic activity of CESA6 by ES20 treatment  reduced the efficiency of CSC transport to the plasma membrane.

The main  classes of cell wall polysaccharides produced by terrestrial plants are  cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins. Members of the cellulose synthase (CESA)  and cellulose synthase-like (CSL) families encode glycosyltransferases that  synthesize the beta-1,4-linked glycan backbones of cellulose and most hemicellulosic  polysaccharides that comprise plant cell walls. Cellulose microfibrils are the  major load-bearing component in plant cell walls and are assembled from  individual beta-1,4-glucan polymers synthesized by CESA proteins that are organized  into multimeric complexes called CESA complexes, in the plant plasma membrane.  During distinct modes of polarized cell wall deposition, such as in the tip  growth that occurs during the formation of root hairs and pollen tubes or de novo  formation of cell plates during plant cytokinesis, newly synthesized cell wall  polysaccharides are deposited in a restricted region of the cell. These processes  require the activity of members of the CESA-like D subfamily. However, while  these CSLD polysaccharide synthases are essential, the nature of the  polysaccharides they synthesize has remained elusive. Here, we use a combination  of genetic rescue experiments with CSLD-CESA chimeric proteins, in vitro  biochemical reconstitution, and supporting computational modeling and simulation,  to demonstrate that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CSLD3 is a  UDP-glucose-dependent beta-1,4-glucan synthase that forms protein complexes  displaying similar ultrastructural features to those formed by CESA6.\n",

            "Stalk lodging in maize (Zea mays) causes significant yield losses due to breaking  of stalk tissue below the ear node before harvest. Here, we identified the maize  brittle stalk4 (bk4) mutant in a Mutator F2 population. This mutant was  characterized by highly brittle aerial parts that broke easily from mechanical  disturbance or in high-wind conditions. The bk4 plants displayed a reduction in  average stalk diameter and mechanical strength, dwarf stature, senescence at leaf  tips, and semisterility of pollen. Histological studies demonstrated a reduction  in lignin staining of cells in the bk4 mutant leaves and stalk, and deformation  of vascular bundles in the stalk resulting in the loss of xylem and phloem  tissues. Biochemical characterization showed a significant reduction in  p-coumaric acid, Glc, Man, and cellulose contents. The candidate gene responsible  for bk4 phenotype is Chitinase-like1 protein (Ctl1), which is expressed at its  highest levels in elongated internodes. Expression levels of secondary cell wall  cellulose synthase genes (CesA) in the bk4 single mutant, and phenotypic  observations in double mutants combining bk4 with bk2 or null alleles for two  CesA genes, confirmed interaction of ZmCtl1 with CesA genes. Overexpression of  ZmCtl1 enhanced mechanical stalk strength without affecting plant stature,  senescence, or fertility. Biochemical characterization of ZmCtl1 overexpressing  lines supported a role for ZmCtl1 in tensile strength enhancement. Conserved  identity of CTL1 peptides across plant species and analysis of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) ctl1-1 ctl2-1 double mutants indicated that Ctl1 might  have a conserved role in plants.\n",

            "Overexpression of cotton cellulose synthase like D3 (GhCSLD3) gene partially  rescued growth defect of atcesa6 mutant with restored cell elongation and cell  wall integrity mainly by enhancing primary cellulose production. Among cellulose  synthase like (CSL) family proteins, CSLDs share the highest sequence similarity  to cellulose synthase (CESA) proteins. Although CSLD proteins have been  implicated to participate in the synthesis of carbohydrate-based polymers  (cellulose, pectins and hemicelluloses), and therefore plant cell wall formation,  the exact biochemical function of CSLD proteins remains controversial and the  function of the remaining CSLD genes in other species have not been determined.  In this study, we attempted to illustrate the function of CSLD proteins by  overexpressing Arabidopsis AtCSLD2, -3, -5 and cotton GhCSLD3 genes in the  atcesa6 mutant, which has a background that is defective for primary cell wall  cellulose synthesis in Arabidopsis. We found that GhCSLD3 overexpression  partially rescued the growth defect of the atcesa6 mutant during early vegetative  growth. Despite the atceas6 mutant having significantly reduced cellulose  contents, the defected cell walls and lower dry mass, GhCSLD3 overexpression  largely restored cell wall integrity (CWI) and improved the biomass yield. Our  result suggests that overexpression of the GhCSLD protein enhances primary cell  wall synthesis and compensates for the loss of CESAs, which is required for  cellulose production, therefore rescuing defects in cell elongation and CWI.\n",

            "Cellulose microfibrils are synthesized by membrane-embedded cellulose synthesis  complexes (CSCs), currently modeled as hexamers of cellulose synthase (CESA)  trimers. The three paralogous CESAs involved in secondary cell wall (SCW)  cellulose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (CESA4, CESA7, CESA8) are similar, but  nonredundant, with all three isoforms required for assembly and function of the  CSC. The molecular basis of protein-protein recognition among the isoforms is not  well understood. To investigate the locations of the interfaces that are  responsible for isoform recognition, we swapped three domains between the  Arabidopsis CESAs required for SCW synthesis (CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8):  N-terminus, central domain containing the catalytic core, and C-terminus.  Chimeric genes with all pairwise permutations of the domains were tested for  in vivo functionality within knockout mutant backgrounds of cesa4, cesa7, and  cesa8. Immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies confirmed the anticipated  protein expression in transgenic plants. The percent recovery of stem height and  crystalline cellulose content was assayed, as compared to wild type, the mutant  background lines, and other controls. Retention of the native central domain was  sufficient for CESA8 chimeras to function, with neither its N-terminal nor  C-terminal domains required. The C-terminal domain is required for class-specific  function of CESA4 and CESA7, and CESA7 also requires its own N-terminus. Across  all isoforms, the results indicate that the central domain, as well as the N- and  C-terminal regions, contributes to class-specific function variously in  Arabidopsis CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8.\n",

            "Cellulose synthesis is precisely regulated by internal and external cues, and  emerging evidence suggests that light regulates cellulose biosynthesis through  specific light receptors. Recently, the blue light receptor CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1)  was shown to positively regulate secondary cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we characterize the role of FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH  REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1), another blue light receptor and well-known photoperiodic  flowering time regulator, in cellulose biosynthesis. A phenotype suppression  screen using a cellulose deficient mutant cesa1(aegeus),cesa3(ixr1-2) (c1,c3),  which carries nonlethal point mutations in CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A 1 (CESA1) and  CESA3, resulted in identification of the phenotype-restoring large leaf (llf)  mutant. Next-generation mapping using the whole genome resequencing method  identified the llf locus as FKF1 FKF1 was confirmed as the causal gene through  observation of the llf phenotype in an independent triple mutant c1,c3,fkf1-t  carrying a FKF1 T-DNA insertion mutant. Moreover, overexpression of FKF1 in llf  plants restored the c1,c3 phenotype. The fkf1 mutants showed significant  increases in cellulose content and CESA gene expression compared with that in  wild-type Columbia-0 plants, suggesting a negative role of FKF1 in cellulose  biosynthesis. Using genetic, molecular, and phenocopy and biochemical evidence,  we have firmly established the role of FKF1 in regulation of cellulose  biosynthesis. In addition, CESA expression analysis showed that diurnal  expression patterns of CESAs are FKF1 independent, whereas their circadian  expression patterns are FKF1 dependent. Overall, our work establishes a role of  FKF1 in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.\n",

            "Plant heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) are involved in heat and other  abiotic stress responses. However, their functions in salt tolerance are little  known. In this study, we characterized the function of a HSF from Arabidopsis,  AtHSFA7b, in salt tolerance. AtHSFA7b is a nuclear protein with transactivation  activity. ChIP-seq combined with an RNA-seq assay indicated that AtHSFA7b  preferentially binds to a novel cis-acting element, termed the E-box-like motif,  to regulate gene expression; it also binds to the heat shock element motif. Under  salt conditions, AtHSFA7b regulates its target genes to mediate serial  physiological changes, including maintaining cellular ion homeostasis, reducing  water loss rate, decreasing reactive oxygen species accumulation, and adjusting  osmotic potential, which ultimately leads to improved salt tolerance.  Additionally, most cellulose synthase-like (CSL) and cellulose synthase (CESA)  family genes were inhibited by AtHSFA7b; some of them were randomly selected for  salt tolerance characterization, and they were mainly found to negatively  modulate salt tolerance. By contrast, some transcription factors (TFs) were  induced by AtHSFA7b; among them, we randomly identified six TFs that positively  regulate salt tolerance. Thus, AtHSFA7b serves as a transactivator that  positively mediates salinity tolerance mainly through binding to the E-box-like  motif to regulate gene expression.\n",

            "How organisms attain their specific shapes and modify their growth patterns in  response to environmental and chemical signals has been the subject of many  investigations. Plant cells are at high turgor pressure and are surrounded by a  rigid yet flexible cell wall, which is the primary determinant of plant growth  and morphogenesis. Cellulose microfibrils, synthesized by plasma  membrane-localized cellulose synthase complexes, are major tension-bearing  components of the cell wall that mediate directional growth. Despite advances in  understanding the genetic and biophysical regulation of morphogenesis, direct  studies of cellulose biosynthesis and its impact on morphogenesis of different  cell and tissue types are largely lacking. In this study, we took advantage of  mutants of three primary cellulose synthase (CESA) genes that are involved in  primary wall cellulose synthesis. Using field emission scanning electron  microscopy, live cell imaging and biophysical measurements, we aimed to  understand how the primary wall CESA complex acts during shoot apical meristem  development.

            "Plant cells sheath themselves in a complex lattice of polysaccharides, proteins  and enzymes forming an integral matrix known as the cell wall. Cellulose  microfibrils, the primary component of cell walls, are synthesized at the plasma  membrane by CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins throughout cellular growth and  are responsible for turgor-driven anisotropic expansion. Associations between  hormone signaling and cell wall biosynthesis have long been suggested, but  recently direct links have been found revealing hormones play key regulatory  roles in cellulose biosynthesis. The radially swollen 1 (rsw1) allele of  Arabidopsis thaliana CESA1 harbors a single amino acid change that renders the  protein unstable at high temperatures. We used the conditional nature of rsw1 to  investigate how auxin contributes to isotropic growth. We found that exogenous  auxin treatment reduces isotropic swelling in rsw1 roots at the restrictive  temperature of 30i inverted question mark(1/2)C. We also discovered decreases in auxin influx between rsw1  and wild-type roots via confocal imaging of AUX1-YFP, even at the permissive  temperature of 19i inverted question mark(1/2)C. Moreover, rsw1 displayed mis-expression of  auxin-responsive and CESA genes. Additionally, we found altered auxin maxima in  rsw1 mutant roots at the onset of swelling using DII-VENUS and DR5:vYFP auxin  reporters. Overall, we conclude disrupted cell wall biosynthesis perturbs auxin  transport leading to altered auxin homeostasis impacting both anisotropic and  isotropic growth that affects overall root morphology.\n",

            "Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is known to accumulate in plants during abiotic  stress conditions and also acts as a signalling molecule. In this study,  Arabidopsis thaliana transgenics overexpressing cytosolic CuZn-superoxide  dismutase (PaSOD) from poly-extremophile high-altitude Himalayan plant Potentilla  atrosanguinea, cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (RaAPX) from Rheum australe and  dual transgenics overexpressing both the genes were developed and analyzed under  salt stress. In comparison to wild-type (WT) or single transgenics, the  performance of dual transgenics under salt stress was better with higher biomass  accumulation and cellulose content. We identified genes involved in cell wall  biosynthesis, including nine cellulose synthases (CesA), seven cellulose  synthase-like proteins together with other wall-related genes. RNA-seq analysis  and qPCR revealed differential regulation of genes (CesA 4, 7 and 8) and  transcription factors (MYB46 and 83) involved in secondary cell wall cellulose  biosynthesis, amongst which most of the cellulose biosynthesis gene showed  upregulation in single (PaSOD line) and dual transgenics at 100 mM salt stress. A  positive correlation between cellulose content and H(2)O(2) accumulation was  observed in these transgenic lines. Further, cellulose content was 1.6-2 folds  significantly higher in PaSOD and dual transgenic lines, 1.4 fold higher in RaAPX  lines as compared to WT plants under stress conditions. Additionally, transgenics  overexpressing PaSOD and RaAPX also displayed higher amounts of phenolics as  compared to WT. The novelty of present study is that H(2)O(2) apart from its role  in signalling, it also provides mechanical strength to plants and aid in plant  biomass production during salt stress by transcriptional activation of cellulose  biosynthesis pathway. This modulation of the cellulose biosynthetic machinery in  plants has the potential to provide insight into plant growth, morphogenesis and  to create plants with enhanced cellulose content for biofuel use.\n",

The molecular and  cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly  understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with  CESA-containing compartments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not  required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that myosin XI and the  actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis  of CESA-containing compartments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that  cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a myosin xik xi1 xi2  triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of  myosin activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased  abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in  myosin-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase  in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation  of CESA-containing compartments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution  spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC  vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of myosin  activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and  reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a  previously undescribed role for myosin in vesicle secretion and cellulose  production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.\n",

De novo assembly produced 148,046 unigenes with more than  40% annotated in public databases, or matched homologs in model plants. More  homologous gene pairs were found in Asparagus genome than in Arabidopsis or rice,  which indicated a close evolutionary relationship between Asparagus and A.  H11648.

As a result, we obtained  CesA1/3/4/5/7 genes with full-length coding region in the four Agave species.  Phylogenetic and expression analysis revealed a conserved evolutionary pattern,  which could not explain the distinct fiber traits in different Agave species.

The primary cell wall (PCW) is produced during cell division and  expansion, determining the cell shape and volume. After cell expansion, specific  types of plant cells produce a lignified wall, known as a secondary cell wall  (SCW). We functionally analyzed Group IIId Arabidopsis AP2/EREBP genes, namely  ERF34, ERF35, ERF38, and ERF39, which are homologs of a rice ERF gene previously  proposed to be related to SCW biosynthesis. Expression analysis revealed that  these four genes are expressed in regions related to cell division and/or cell  differentiation in seedlings (i.e., shoot apical meristems, the primordia of  leaves and lateral roots, trichomes, and central cylinder of primary roots) and  flowers (i.e., vascular tissues of floral organs and replums and/or valve margins  of pistils). Overexpression of ERF genes significantly upregulated PCW-type, but  not SCW-type, CESA genes encoding cellulose synthase catalytic subunits in  Arabidopsis seedlings. Transient co-expression reporter analysis indicated that  ERF35, ERF38, and ERF39 possess transcriptional activator activity, and that  ERF34, ERF35, ERF38, and ERF39 upregulated the promoter activity of CESA1, a  PCW-type CESA gene, through the DRECRTCOREAT elements, the core cis-acting  elements known to be recognized by AP2/ERF proteins.

            "The cellulose synthase gene superfamily, which includes the cellulose synthase  (CesA) and cellulose synthase-like (Csl) gene families, plays a vital role in the  biosynthesis of cellulose and hemicellulose in plants. However, these genes have  not been extensively studied in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a model for  Solanaceae plants and for fleshy fruit development. Here, we identified and  systematically analyzed 38 CesA/Csl family members that contained cellulose  synthase domain regions, and categorized their encoded proteins into 6  subfamilies (CesA, CslA, CslB, CslD, CslE, and CslG) based on phylogenetic  analysis. Most CesA/Csl genes from tomato are closely related to those from  Arabidopsis, but the families have distinct features regarding gene structure,  chromosome distribution and localization, phylogeny, and deduced protein  sequence, indicating that they arose via different evolutionary process.  Furthermore, expression analysis of CesA/Csl genes in different tissues at  various developmental stages showed that most CesAs were constitutively expressed  with differential expression levels in various organs; three CslD genes were  expressed specifically in flowers, and four CesA and five Csl putative genes were  preferentially expressed in fruits. Our results provide insight into the general  characteristics of the CesA/Csl genes in tomato, and lay the foundation for  further functional studies of CesA/Csl genes in tomato and other Solanaceae  species.\n",

            "The differentiation of the seed coat epidermal (SCE) cells in Arabidopsis  thaliana leads to the production of a large amount of pectin-rich mucilage and a  thick cellulosic secondary cell wall. The mechanisms by which cortical  microtubules are involved in the formation of these pectinaceous and cellulosic  cell walls are still largely unknown. Using a reverse genetic approach, we found  that TONNEAU1 (TON1) recruiting motif 4 (TRM4) is implicated in cortical  microtubule organization in SCE cells, and functions as a novel player in the  establishment of mucilage structure. TRM4 is preferentially accumulated in the  SCE cells at the stage of mucilage biosynthesis. The loss of TRM4 results in  compact seed mucilage capsules, aberrant mucilage cellulosic structure, short  cellulosic rays and disorganized cellulose microfibrils in mucilage. The defects  could be rescued by transgene complementation of trm4 alleles. Probably, this is  a consequence of a disrupted organization of cortical microtubules, observed  using fluorescently tagged tubulin proteins in trm4 SCE cells. Furthermore, TRM4  proteins co-aligned with microtubules and interacted directly with CELLULOSE  SYNTHASE 3 in two independent assays. Together, the results indicate that TRM4 is  essential for microtubule array organization and therefore correct cellulose  orientation in the SCE cells, as well as the establishment of the subsequent  mucilage architecture.\n",

            "Cell walls play critical roles in plants, regulating tissue mechanics, defining  the extent and orientation of cell expansion, and providing a physical barrier  against pathogen attack [1]. Cellulose microfibrils, which are synthesized by  plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes, are the primary  load-bearing elements of plant cell walls [2]. Cell walls are dynamic structures  that are regulated in part by cell wall integrity (CWI)-monitoring systems that  feed back to modulate wall properties and the synthesis of new wall components  [3]. Several receptor-like kinases have been implicated as sensors of CWI [3-5],  including the FEI1/FEI2 receptor-like kinases [4]. Here, we characterize two  genes encoding novel plant-specific plasma membrane proteins (SHOU4 and SHOU4L)  that were identified in a suppressor screen of the cellulose-deficient fei1 fei2  mutant. shou4 shou4l double mutants display phenotypes consistent with elevated  levels of cellulose, and elevated levels of non-crystalline cellulose are present  in this mutant. Disruption of SHOU4 and SHOU4L increases the abundance of CESA  proteins at the plasma membrane as a result of enhanced exocytosis. The SHOU4/4L  N-terminal cytosolic domains directly interact with CESAs. Our results suggest  that the SHOU4 proteins regulate cellulose synthesis in plants by influencing the  trafficking of CESA complexes to the cell surface.\n",

            "The cellulose synthase (CESA) proteins in Arabidopsis play an essential role in  the production of cellulose in the cell walls. Herbicides such as isoxaben and  flupoxam specifically target this production process and are prominent cellulose  biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs). Forward genetic screens in Arabidopsis revealed  that mutations that can result in varying degrees of resistance to either  isoxaben or flupoxam CBI can be attributed to single amino acid substitutions in  primary wall CESAs. Missense mutations were almost exclusively present in the  predicted transmembrane regions of CESA1, CESA3, and CESA6. Resistance to  isoxaben was also conferred by modification to the catalytic residues of CESA3.  This resulted in cellulose deficient phenotypes characterized by reduced  crystallinity and dwarfism. However, mapping of mutations to the transmembrane  regions also lead to growth phenotypes and altered cellulose crystallinity  phenotypes. These results provide further genetic evidence supporting the  involvement of CESA transmembrane regions in cellulose biosynthesis.\n",

            "In plants, plasma membrane-embedded CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) enzyme complexes  deposit cellulose polymers into the developing cell wall. Cellulose synthesis  requires two different sets of CESA complexes that are active during cell  expansion and secondary cell wall thickening, respectively. Hence, developing  xylem cells, which first undergo cell expansion and subsequently deposit thick  secondary walls, need to completely reorganize their CESA complexes from primary  wall- to secondary wall-specific CESAs. Using live-cell imaging, we analyzed the  principles underlying this remodeling. At the onset of secondary wall synthesis,  the primary wall CESAs ceased to be delivered to the plasma membrane and were  gradually removed from both the plasma membrane and the Golgi. For a brief  transition period, both primary wall- and secondary wall-specific CESAs coexisted  in banded domains of the plasma membrane where secondary wall synthesis is  concentrated. During this transition, primary and secondary wall CESAs displayed  discrete dynamic behaviors and sensitivities to the inhibitor isoxaben. As  secondary wall-specific CESAs were delivered and inserted into the plasma  membrane, the primary wall CESAs became concentrated in prevacuolar compartments  and lytic vacuoles. This adjustment in localization between the two CESAs was  accompanied by concurrent decreased primary wall CESA and increased secondary  wall CESA protein abundance. Our data reveal distinct and dynamic subcellular  trafficking patterns that underpin the remodeling of the cellulose biosynthetic  machinery, resulting in the removal and degradation of the primary wall CESA  complex with concurrent production and recycling of the secondary wall CESAs.\n",

            "Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase complexes  (CSCs) containing cellulose synthases (CESAs). Genetic analysis and CESA isoform  quantification indicate that cellulose in the secondary cell walls of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) is synthesized by isoforms CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8 in  equimolar amounts. Here, we used quantitative proteomics to investigate whether  the CSC model based on Arabidopsis secondary cell wall CESA stoichiometry can be  applied to the angiosperm tree aspen (Populus tremula) and the gymnosperm tree  Norway spruce (Picea abies). In the developing xylem of aspen, the secondary cell  wall CESA stoichiometry was 3:2:1 for PtCESA8a/b:PtCESA4:PtCESA7a/b, while in  Norway spruce, the stoichiometry was 1:1:1, as observed previously in  Arabidopsis. Furthermore, in aspen tension wood, the secondary cell wall CESA  stoichiometry changed to 8:3:1 for PtCESA8a/b:PtCESA4:PtCESA7a/b. PtCESA8b  represented 73% of the total secondary cell wall CESA pool, and quantitative  polymerase chain reaction analysis of CESA transcripts in cryosectioned tension  wood revealed increased PtCESA8b expression during the formation of the  cellulose-enriched gelatinous layer, while the transcripts of PtCESA4,  PtCESA7a/b, and PtCESA8a decreased. A wide-angle x-ray scattering analysis showed  that the shift in CESA stoichiometry in tension wood coincided with an increase  in crystalline cellulose microfibril diameter, suggesting that the CSC CESA  composition influences microfibril properties. The aspen CESA stoichiometry  results raise the possibility of alternative CSC models and suggest that  homomeric PtCESA8b complexes are responsible for cellulose biosynthesis in the  gelatinous layer in tension wood.\n",

            "Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The structure  of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the structure of the  cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to  24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three  different classes of CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis and for  secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis these classes are represented by  CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and  microfibril structure, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic  activity but retain sufficient structural integrity to allow assembly of the  cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent differences in the ability  of these mutant cesa proteins to complement the cellulose-deficient phenotype of  the cesa null mutants. The best complementation was observed with catalytically  inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly  lower levels of complementation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques,  including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared  microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in  cellulose microfibril structure, but these changes largely correlated with  cellulose content and reflected differences in the relative proportions of  primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA  classes have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril structure, and it  is likely that the different effects of mutating members of different CESA  classes are the consequence of their different catalytic activity and their  influence on the overall rate of cellulose synthesis.\n",

            "Cellulose is the most characteristic component of plant cell walls, and plays a  central role in plant mechanical strength and morphogenesis. Despite the fact  that cellulose synthase (CesA) mutants exhibit a reduction in cellulose level,  much remains unknown about their impacts on cell growth (elongation and division)  and cell wall integrity that fundamentally determine plant growth. Here, we  examined three major types of AtCesA mutants (rsw1, an AtCesA1 mutant; prc1-1 and  cesa6, AtCesA6-null mutants; and IRX3, an AtCesA7 mutant) and transgenic mutants  that overexpressed AtCesA genes in the background of AtCesA6-null mutants. We  found that AtCesA6-null mutants showed a reduced cell elongation of young  seedlings with little impact on cell division, which consequently affected cell  wall integrity and biomass yield of mature plants. In comparison, rsw1 seedlings  exhibited a strong defect in both cell elongation and division at restrictive  temperature, whereas the IRX3 mutant showed normal seedling growth. Analyses of  transgenic mutants indicated that primary wall AtCesA2, AtCesA3, AtCesA5 and  AtCesA9 genes played a partial role in restoration of seedling growth. However,  co-overexpression of AtCesA2 and AtCesA5 in AtCesA6-null mutants could greatly  enhance cell division and fully restore wall integrity, leading to a significant  increase in secondary wall thickness and biomass production in mature plants.  Hence, this study has demonstrated distinct functions of AtCesA genes in plant  cell growth and cell wall deposition for biomass production, which helps to  expalin our recent finding that only three AtCesA6-like genes, rather than other  AtCesA genes of the AtCesA family, could greatly enhance biomass production in  transgenic Arabidopsis plants.\n",

It had long been thought that a major means of CESA regulation  was via their rapid degradation. However, our studies here have uncovered that  AtCESA proteins are not rapidly degraded. Rather, they persist for an extended  time in the plant cell. Plant cellulose is synthesized by membrane-embedded  cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs). The CSC is composed of cellulose synthases  (CESAs), of which three distinct isozymes form the primary cell wall CSC and  another set of three isozymes form the secondary cell wall CSC. We determined the  stability over time of primary cell wall (PCW) CESAs in Arabidopsis thaliana  seedlings, using immunoblotting after inhibiting protein synthesis with  cycloheximide treatment. Our work reveals very slow turnover for the Arabidopsis  PCW CESAs in vivo. Additionally, we show that the stability of all three CESAs  within the PCW CSC is altered by mutations in individual CESAs, elevated  temperature, and light conditions. Together, these results suggest that CESA  proteins are very stable in vivo, but that their lifetimes can be modulated by  intrinsic and environmental cues.\n",

However, this method has been applied only in Arabidopsis  thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon thus far. Results from freeze fracture  electron microscopy of protonemal filaments of the moss Funaria hygrometrica  indicate that a cellulose synthesis inhibitor, 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB),  fragments CSCs and clears them from the plasma membrane. This differs from  Arabidopsis, in which DCB causes CSC accumulation in the plasma membrane and a  different cellulose synthesis inhibitor, isoxaben, clears CSCs from the plasma  membrane. In this study, live cell imaging of the moss Physcomitrella patens  indicated that DCB and isoxaben have little effect on protonemal growth rates,  and that only DCB causes tip rupture. Live cell imaging of mEGFP-PpCESA5 and  mEGFP-PpCESA8 showed that DCB and isoxaben substantially reduced CSC movement,  but had no measureable effect on CSC density in the plasma membrane.

We generated lines in which mEGFP is fused N-terminal to  BdCESA3 or BdCESA6 and which grew indistinguishably from the wild type (Bd21-3)  and had dense fluorescent puncta at or near the plasma membrane. Measured with a  particle tracking algorithm, the average speed of GFP-BdCESA3 particles in the  mesocotyl was 164 +/- 78 nm min(-1) (error gives standard deviation [SD], n = 1451  particles). Mean speed in the root appeared similar. For comparison, average  speed in the A. thaliana hypocotyl expressing GFP-AtCESA6 was 184 +/- 86 nm min(-1)  (n = 2755). For B. distachyon, we quantified root diameter and elongation rate in  response to inhibitors of cellulose (dichlorobenylnitrile; DCB), microtubules  (oryzalin), or actin (latrunculin B). Neither oryzalin nor latrunculin affected  the speed of CESA complexes; whereas, DCB reduced average speed by about 50% in  B. distachyon and by about 35% in A. thaliana.

            "BACKGROUND: Cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs) are pre-emergence herbicides  that inhibit anisotropic cell expansion resulting in a severely swollen and  stunted growth phenotype. Resistance to group 21 CBIs, such as isoxaben, is  conferred by missense mutations in CELLOSE SYNTHASE A (CesA) genes required for  primary cell wall synthesis, concluding that this is their in vivo target.  RESULTS: Herein, we show that grasses exhibit tolerance to group 21 CBIs and  explore the mechanism of tolerance to isoxaben in the grass Brachypodium  distachyon (L.). Comparative genomics failed to identify synonymous point  mutations that have been found to confer isoxaben resistance in the dicot  Arabidopsis thaliana (L.). Brachypodium did not metabolize (14) C-isoxaben. We  next explored the role of grass-specific non-cellulosic cell wall components,  specifically the hemicellulose polysaccharide mix linkage glucans (MLG), as a  potential tolerance mechanism by compensating for the loss of cellulose during  cell elongation. A partial-transcriptional knockdown T-DNA insertion was found in  a key MLG synthesis gene, Cellulose synthase-like F6 (CslF6) and this mutant was  found to be 2.1 times more sensitive to isoxaben than wild-type plants.  CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the composition and compensatory response of  grass cell walls may be a factor in conferring tolerance to group 21 CBIs.

Cellulose is also a central component to plant morphogenesis and  contributes the bulk of a plant's biomass. While cellulose synthase (CesA) genes  were identified over two decades ago, genetic manipulation of this family to  enhance cellulose production has remained difficult. In this study, we show that  increasing the expression levels of the three primary cell wall AtCesA6-like  genes (AtCesA2, AtCesA5, AtCesA6), but not AtCesA3, AtCesA9 or secondary cell  wall AtCesA7, can promote the expression of major primary wall CesA genes to  accelerate primary wall CesA complex (cellulose synthase complexes, CSCs)  particle movement for acquiring long microfibrils and consequently increasing  cellulose production in Arabidopsis transgenic lines, as compared with wild-type.  The overexpression transgenic lines displayed changes in expression of genes  related to cell growth and proliferation, perhaps explaining the enhanced growth  of the transgenic seedlings. Notably, overexpression of the three AtCesA6-like  genes also enhanced secondary cell wall deposition that led to improved  mechanical strength and higher biomass production in transgenic mature plants.  Hence, we propose that overexpression of certain AtCesA genes can provide a  biotechnological approach to increase cellulose synthesis and biomass  accumulation in transgenic plants.\n",

            "Cellulose-synthase proteins (CESAs) are membrane localized proteins and they form  protein complexes to produce cellulose in the plasma membrane. CESA proteins play  very important roles in cell wall construction during plant growth and  development. In this study, a total of 21 NtCESA gene sequences were identified  by using PF03552 conserved protein sequence and 10 AtCESA protein sequences of  Arabidopsis thaliana to blast against the common tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.)  genome database with TBLASTN protocol. We analyzed the physical and chemical  properties of protein sequences based on some software or on-line analysis tools.  The results showed that there were no significant variances in terms of the  physical and chemical properties of the 21 NtCESA proteins. First, phylogenetic  tree analysis showed that 21 NtCESA genes and 10 AtCESA genes were clustered into  five groups, and the gene structures were similar among the genes that are  clustered into the same group. Second, in all of the 21 NtCESA proteins the  conserved zinc finger domain was identified in the N-terminus, transmembrane  domains were identified in the C-terminus and the DDD-QXXRW conserved domains  were also identified. Third, gene expression analysis results indicated that most  NtCESA genes were expressed in roots and leaves of seedling or mature tissues of  tobacco, seeds and callus tissues. The genes that clustered into the same group  share similar expression patterns. Importantly, NtCESA proteins that are involved  in secondary cell wall cellulose synthesis have two extra transmembrane domains  compared with that involved in primary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis. In  addition, subcellular localization results showed that NtCESA9 and NtCESA14 were  two plasma membrane anchored proteins. This study will lay a foundation for  further functional characterization of these NtCESA genes.\n",

            "The secondary cell walls of tracheary elements and fibers are rich in cellulose  microfibrils that are helically oriented and laterally aggregated. Support cells  within the leaf midribs of mosses deposit cellulose-rich secondary cell walls,  but their biosynthesis and microfibril organization have not been examined.  Although the Cellulose Synthase (CESA) gene families of mosses and seed plants  diversified independently, CESA knockout analysis in the moss Physcomitrella  patens revealed parallels with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) in CESA  functional specialization, with roles for both subfunctionalization and  neofunctionalization. The similarities include regulatory uncoupling of the CESAs  that synthesize primary and secondary cell walls, a requirement for two or more  functionally distinct CESA isoforms for secondary cell wall synthesis,  interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy.  The cellulose-deficient midribs of ppcesa3/8 knockouts provided negative controls  for the structural characterization of stereid secondary cell walls in wild type  P. patens Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent  with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and polarization microscopy revealed  helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary  walls are structurally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share  structural characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and  fibers. We propose a mechanism for the convergent evolution of secondary walls in  which the deposition of aggregated and helically oriented microfibrils is coupled  to rapid and highly localized cellulose synthesis enabled by regulatory  uncoupling from primary wall synthesis.\n",

These enzymes are vital for maintaining cell-wall structural  integrity throughout plant life. Here, we identified 78 putative cellulose  synthases (CS) in the soybean genome. Phylogenetic analysis against 40 reference  Arabidopsis CS genes clustered soybean CSs into seven major groups (CESA, CSL A,  B, C, D, E and G), located on 19 chromosomes (except chromosome 18). Soybean CS  expansion occurred in 66 duplication events. Additionally, we identified 95  simple sequence repeat makers related to 44 CSs. We next performed digital  expression analysis using publically available datasets to understand potential  CS functions in soybean. We found that CSs were highly expressed during soybean  seed development, a pattern confirmed with an Affymatrix soybean IVT array and  validated with RNA-seq profiles. Within CS groups, CESAs had higher relative  expression than CSLs. Soybean CS models were designed based on maximum average  RPKM values. Gene co-expression networks were developed to explore which CSs  could work together in soybean. Finally, RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression  of 15 selected CSs during all four seed developmental stages.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Domain of Unknown Function 266 (DUF266) is a plant-specific domain.  DUF266-containing proteins (DUF266 proteins) have been categorized as 'not  classified glycosyltransferases (GTnc)' due to amino acid similarity with GTs.  However, little is known about the function of DUF266 proteins. RESULTS:  Phylogenetic analysis revealed that DUF266 proteins are only present in the land  plants including moss and lycophyte. We report the functional characterization of  one member of DUF266 proteins in Populus, PdDUF266A. PdDUF266A was ubiquitously  expressed with high abundance in the xylem. In Populus transgenic plants  overexpressing PdDUF266A (OXPdDUF266A), the glucose and cellulose contents were  significantly higher, while the lignin content was lower than that in the wild  type. Degree of polymerization of cellulose in OXPdDUF266A transgenic plants was  also higher, whereas cellulose crystallinity index remained unchanged. Gene  expression analysis indicated that cellulose biosynthesis-related genes such as  CESA and SUSY were upregulated in mature leaf and xylem of OXPdDUF266A transgenic  plants. Moreover, PdDUF266A overexpression resulted in an increase of biomass  production. Their glucose contents and biomass phenotypes were further validated  via heterologous expression of PdDUF266A in Arabidopsis. Results from  saccharification treatment demonstrated that the rate of sugar release was  increased by approximately 38% in the OXPdDUF266A transgenic plants. CONCLUSIONS:  These results suggest that the overexpression of PdDUF266A can increase cellulose  content, reduce recalcitrance, and enhance biomass production, and that PdDUF266A  is a promising target for genetic manipulation for biofuel production.\n",

There is currently no  high-spatial-resolution data available profiling gene expression during wood  formation for any coniferous species, which limits insight into tracheid  development. RNA-sequencing data from replicated, high-spatial-resolution section  series throughout the cambial and woody tissues of Picea abies were used to  generate the NorWood.conGenIE.org web resource, which facilitates exploration of  the associated gene expression profiles and co-expression networks.

Two types of CSCs in Arabidopsis are believed to be involved in  cellulose synthesis in the primary cell wall and secondary cell walls,  respectively. In this work, we found that the two type CSCs participated  cellulose biosynthesis in differentiating xylem cells undergoing secondary cell  wall thickening in Populus. During the cell wall thickening process, expression  of one type CSC genes increased while expression of the other type CSC genes  decreased. Suppression of different type CSC genes both affected the  wall-thickening and disrupted the multilaminar structure of the secondary cell  walls. When CesA7A was suppressed, crystalline cellulose content was reduced,  which, however, showed an increase when CesA3D was suppressed. The CesA  suppression also affected cellulose digestibility of the wood cell walls.

These chains form the microfibrils  that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three  different classes of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC However, while  organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA  proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA  proteins map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure,  indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However,  plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting  the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions  between CESA proteins and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study,  we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary  cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different  CESA proteins and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our  results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the protein  and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different  CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely  to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC  rather than their primary structure.\n",

Plants construct two types of cell walls,  primary cell walls (PCWs) and secondary cell walls (SCWs), which differ in  composition, structure, and purpose. Cellulose in PCWs and SCWs is chemically  identical but has different physical characteristics. During PCW synthesis,  multiple dispersed CSCs move along a shared linear track in opposing directions  while synthesizing cellulose microfibrils with low aggregation. In contrast,  during SCW synthesis, we observed swaths of densely arranged CSCs that moved in  the same direction along tracks while synthesizing cellulose microfibrils that  became highly aggregated. Our data support a model in which distinct  spatiotemporal features of active CSCs during PCW and SCW synthesis contribute to  the formation of cellulose with distinct structure and organization in PCWs and  SCWs of Arabidopsis thaliana This study provides a foundation for understanding  differences in the formation, structure, and organization of cellulose in PCWs  and SCWs.\n",

Analysis of Arabidopsis CESA7 reveals  four cysteines in variable region 2 (VR2) and two cysteines at the carboxy  terminus (CT) as S-acylation sites. Mutating both the VR2 and CT cysteines  permits CSC assembly and trafficking to the Golgi but prevents localization to  the plasma membrane.

In the  absence of STELLO function, the spatial distribution within the Golgi, secretion  and activity of the CSCs are impaired indicating a central role of the STELLO  proteins in CSC assembly.

Mutation of S211 to Ala caused a significant decrease in the length of etiolated  hypocotyls and primary roots, while root hairs were not significantly affected.  By contrast, the S211E mutation stunted the growth of root hairs, but primary  roots were not significantly affected. Similarly, T212E caused a decrease in the  length of root hairs but not root length. However, T212E stunted the growth of  etiolated hypocotyls. Live-cell imaging of fluorescently labeled CESA showed that  the rate of movement of CESA particles was directionally asymmetric in etiolated  hypocotyls of S211A and T212E mutants, while similar bidirectional velocities  were observed with the wild-type control and S211E and T212A mutant lines.  Analysis of cell wall composition and the innermost layer of cell wall suggests a  role for phosphorylation of CESA3 S211 and T212 in cellulose aggregation into  fibrillar bundles. These results suggest that microtubule-guided bidirectional  mobility of CESA complexes is fine-tuned by phosphorylation of CESA3 S211 and  T212, which may, in turn, modulate cellulose synthesis and organization,  resulting in or contributing to the observed defects of anisotropic cell  expansion.\n",

            "Stomatal guard cells are pairs of specialized epidermal cells that control water  and CO2 exchange between the plant and the environment. To fulfill the functions  of stomatal opening and closure that are driven by changes in turgor pressure,  guard cell walls must be both strong and flexible, but how the structure and  dynamics of guard cell walls enable stomatal function remains poorly understood.  To address this question, we applied cell biological and genetic analyses to  investigate guard cell walls and their relationship to stomatal function in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Using live-cell spinning disk confocal  microscopy, we measured the motility of cellulose synthase (CESA)-containing  complexes labeled by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CESA3 and observed a reduced  proportion of GFP-CESA3 particles colocalizing with microtubules upon stomatal  closure. Imaging cellulose organization in guard cells revealed a relatively  uniform distribution of cellulose in the open state and a more fibrillar pattern  in the closed state, indicating that cellulose microfibrils undergo dynamic  reorganization during stomatal movements. In cesa3(je5) mutants defective in  cellulose synthesis and xxt1 xxt2 mutants lacking the hemicellulose xyloglucan,  stomatal apertures, changes in guard cell length, and cellulose reorganization  were aberrant during fusicoccin-induced stomatal opening or abscisic acid-induced  stomatal closure, indicating that sufficient cellulose and xyloglucan are  required for normal guard cell dynamics. Together, these results provide new  insights into how guard cell walls allow stomata to function as responsive  mediators of gas exchange at the plant surface.\n",

            "Cellulose synthases (CESAs) synthesize the beta-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to  form cellulose microfibrils in plant cell walls. In addition to a large cytosolic  (catalytic) domain, CESAs have eight predicted transmembrane helices (TMHs).  However, analogous to the structure of BcsA, a bacterial CESA, predicted TMH5 in  CESA may instead be an interfacial helix. This would place the conserved FxVTxK  motif in the plant cell cytosol where it could function as a substrate-gating  loop as occurs in BcsA. To define the functional importance of the CESA region  containing FxVTxK, we tested five parallel mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana  CESA1 and Physcomitrella patens CESA5 in complementation assays of the relevant  cesa mutants. In both organisms, the substitution of the valine or lysine  residues in FxVTxK severely affected CESA function. In Arabidopsis roots, both  changes were correlated with lower cellulose anisotropy, as revealed by Pontamine  Fast Scarlet. Analysis of hypocotyl inner cell wall layers by atomic force  microscopy showed that two altered versions of Atcesa1 could rescue cell wall  phenotypes observed in the mutant background line. Overall, the data show that  the FxVTxK motif is functionally important in two phylogenetically distant plant  CESAs. The results show that Physcomitrella provides an efficient model for  assessing the effects of engineered CESA mutations affecting primary cell wall  synthesis and that diverse testing systems can lead to nuanced insights into CESA  structure-function relationships. Although CESA membrane topology needs to be  experimentally determined, the results support the possibility that the FxVTxK  region functions similarly in CESA and BcsA.\n",

            "Several underutilized grasses have excellent potential for use as bioenergy  feedstock due to their lignocellulosic biomass. Genomic tools have enabled  identification of lignocellulose biosynthesis genes in several sequenced plants.  However, the non-availability of whole genome sequence of bioenergy grasses  hinders the study on bioenergy genomics and their genomics-assisted crop  improvement. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.; Si) is a model crop for studying  systems biology of bioenergy grasses. In the present study, a systematic approach  has been used for identification of gene families involved in cellulose  (CesA/Csl), callose (Gsl) and monolignol biosynthesis (PAL, C4H, 4CL, HCT, C3H,  CCoAOMT, F5H, COMT, CCR, CAD) and construction of physical map of foxtail millet.  Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of identified proteins showed that  monolignol biosynthesis proteins were highly diverse, whereas CesA/Csl and Gsl  proteins were homologous to rice and Arabidopsis. Comparative mapping of foxtail  millet lignocellulose biosynthesis genes with other C4 panicoid genomes revealed  maximum homology with switchgrass, followed by sorghum and maize. Expression  profiling of candidate lignocellulose genes in response to different abiotic  stresses and hormone treatments showed their differential expression pattern,  with significant higher expression of SiGsl12, SiPAL2, SiHCT1, SiF5H2, and SiCAD6  genes. Further, due to the evolutionary conservation of grass genomes, the  insights gained from the present study could be extrapolated for identifying  genes involved in lignocellulose biosynthesis in other biofuel species for  further characterization.\n",

            "A cellulose synthesis complex with a \"rosette\" shape is responsible for synthesis  of cellulose chains and their assembly into microfibrils within the cell walls of  land plants and their charophyte algal progenitors. The number of cellulose  synthase proteins in this large multisubunit transmembrane protein complex and  the number of cellulose chains in a microfibril have been debated for many years.  This work reports a low resolution structure of the catalytic domain of CESA1  from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; AtCESA1CatD) determined by small-angle  scattering techniques and provides the first experimental evidence for the  self-assembly of CESA into a stable trimer in solution. The catalytic domain was  overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and using a two-step procedure, it was  possible to isolate monomeric and trimeric forms of AtCESA1CatD. The conformation  of monomeric and trimeric AtCESA1CatD proteins were studied using small-angle  neutron scattering and small-angle x-ray scattering. A series of AtCESA1CatD  trimer computational models were compared with the small-angle x-ray scattering  trimer profile to explore the possible arrangement of the monomers in the  trimers. Several candidate trimers were identified with monomers oriented such  that the newly synthesized cellulose chains project toward the cell membrane. In  these models, the class-specific region is found at the periphery of the complex,  and the plant-conserved region forms the base of the trimer. This study strongly  supports the \"hexamer of trimers\" model for the rosette cellulose synthesis  complex that synthesizes an 18-chain cellulose microfibril as its fundamental  product.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: Lignocellulosic biomass is an important renewable resource for  biofuels and materials. How plants synthesise cellulose is not completely  understood. It is known that cellulose synthase complex (CSCs) moving in the  plasma membrane synthesise the cellulose. CESA proteins are the core components  of CSC. In Arabidopsis, in vitro mutagenesis of proteins followed by  complementation analysis of mutants lacking the gene represents an important tool  for studying any biological process, including cellulose biosynthesis. Analysis  of a large number of plants is crucial for these types of studies. RESULTS: By  using aspiration rather than centrifugation to remove liquids during various  stages of protocol, we were able to increase the throughput of the method as well  as minimise the sample loss. As a test case, we determined cellulose content of  wild type and secondary wall cesa mutants across the length of primary shoot  which was fond to be rather uniform in 7-week-old plants. Additionally, we found  that the cellulose content of single mutants was comparable to the higher order  mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Here we describe a medium-throughput adaptation of  Updegraff's method that allowed us to determine cellulose content of 200 samples  each week.\n",

            "Plants are constantly subjected to various biotic and abiotic stresses and have  evolved complex strategies to cope with these stresses. For example, plant cells  endocytose plasma membrane material under stress and subsequently recycle it back  when the stress conditions are relieved. Cellulose biosynthesis is a tightly  regulated process that is performed by plasma membrane-localized cellulose  synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). However, the regulatory mechanism of cellulose  biosynthesis under abiotic stress has not been well explored. In this study, we  show that small CESA compartments (SmaCCs) or microtubule-associated cellulose  synthase compartments (MASCs) are critical for fast recovery of CSCs to the  plasma membrane after stress is relieved in Arabidopsis thaliana. This  SmaCC/MASC-mediated fast recovery of CSCs is dependent on CELLULOSE SYNTHASE  INTERACTIVE1 (CSI1), a protein previously known to represent the link between  CSCs and cortical microtubules. Independently, AP2M, a core component in  clathrin-mediated endocytosis, plays a role in the formation of SmaCCs/MASCs.  Together, our study establishes a model in which CSI1-dependent SmaCCs/MASCs are  formed through a process that involves endocytosis, which represents an important  mechanism for plants to quickly regulate cellulose synthesis under abiotic  stress.\n",

            "Cellulose biosynthesis is performed exclusively by plasma membrane-localized  cellulose synthases (CESAs). Therefore, the trafficking of CESAs to and from the  plasma membrane is an important mechanism for regulating cellulose biosynthesis.  CESAs were recently identified as cargo proteins of the classic adaptor protein 2  (AP2) complex of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) pathway. The AP2 complex  of the CME pathway is conserved in yeast, animals, and plants, and has been  well-characterized in many systems. In contrast, the recently discovered TPLATE  complex (TPC), which is proposed to function as a CME adaptor complex, is only  conserved in plants and a few other eukaryotes. In this study, we discovered that  the TWD40-2 protein, a putative member of the TPC, is also important for the  endocytosis of CESAs. Genetic analysis between TWD40-2 and AP2M of the AP2  complex revealed that the roles of TWD40-2 in CME are both distinct from and  cooperative with the AP2 complex. Loss of efficient CME in twd40-2-3 resulted in  the unregulated overaccumulation of CESAs at the plasma membrane. In seedlings of  twd40-2-3 and other CME-deficient mutants, a direct correlation was revealed  between endocytic deficiency and cellulose content deficiency, highlighting the  importance of controlled CESA endocytosis in regulating cellulose biosynthesis.\n",

            "Cellulose, which can be converted into numerous industrial products, has  important impacts on the global economy. It has long been known that cellulose  synthesis in plants is tightly regulated by various phytohormones. However, the  underlying mechanism of cellulose synthesis regulation remains elusive. Here, we  show that in rice (Oryza sativa), gibberellin (GA) signals promote cellulose  synthesis by relieving the interaction between SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA  repressor of GA signaling, and NACs, the top-layer transcription factors for  secondary wall formation. Mutations in GA-related genes and physiological  treatments altered the transcription of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE genes (CESAs) and the  cellulose level. Multiple experiments demonstrated that transcription factors  NAC29/31 and MYB61 are CESA regulators in rice; NAC29/31 directly regulates  MYB61, which in turn activates CESA expression. This hierarchical regulation  pathway is blocked by SLR1-NAC29/31 interactions. Based on the results of  anatomical analysis and GA content examination in developing rice internodes,  this signaling cascade was found to be modulated by varied endogenous GA levels  and to be required for internode development. Genetic and gene expression  analyses were further performed in Arabidopsis thaliana GA-related mutants.  Altogether, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism by which GA regulates  secondary wall cellulose synthesis in land plants and provide a strategy for  manipulating cellulose production and plant growth.\n",

            "Cellulose synthase5 (CESA5) synthesizes cellulose necessary for seed mucilage  adherence to seed coat epidermal cells of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The  involvement of additional CESA proteins in this process and details concerning  the manner in which cellulose is deposited in the mucilage pocket are unknown.  Here, we show that both CESA3 and CESA10 are highly expressed in this cell type  at the time of mucilage synthesis and localize to the plasma membrane adjacent to  the mucilage pocket. The isoxaben resistant1-1 and isoxaben resistant1-2 mutants  affecting CESA3 show defects consistent with altered mucilage cellulose  biosynthesis. CESA3 can interact with CESA5 in vitro, and green fluorescent  protein-tagged CESA5, CESA3, and CESA10 proteins move in a linear, unidirectional  fashion around the cytoplasmic column of the cell, parallel with the surface of  the seed, in a pattern similar to that of cortical microtubules. Consistent with  this movement, cytological evidence suggests that the mucilage is coiled around  the columella and unwinds during mucilage extrusion to form a linear ray.  Mutations in CESA5 and CESA3 affect the speed of mucilage extrusion and mucilage  adherence. These findings imply that cellulose fibrils are synthesized in an  ordered helical array around the columella, providing a distinct structure to the  mucilage that is important for both mucilage extrusion and adherence.\n",

            "The cell's endomembranes comprise an intricate, highly dynamic and well-organized  system. In plants, the proteins that regulate function of the various  endomembrane compartments and their cargo remain largely unknown. Our aim was to  dissect subcellular trafficking routes by enriching for partially overlapping  subpopulations of endosomal proteomes associated with endomembrane markers. We  selected RABD2a/ARA5, RABF2b/ARA7, RABF1/ARA6, and RABG3f as markers for  combinations of the Golgi, trans-Golgi network (TGN), early endosomes (EE),  secretory vesicles, late endosomes (LE), multivesicular bodies (MVB), and the  tonoplast. As comparisons we used Golgi transport 1 (GOT1), which localizes to  the Golgi, clathrin light chain 2 (CLC2) labeling clathrin-coated vesicles and  pits and the vesicle-associated membrane protein 711 (VAMP711) present at the  tonoplast. We developed an easy-to-use method by refining published protocols  based on affinity purification of fluorescent fusion constructs to these seven  subcellular marker proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. We present a total  of 433 proteins, only five of which were shared among all enrichments, while many  proteins were common between endomembrane compartments of the same trafficking  route. Approximately half, 251 proteins, were assigned to one enrichment only.  Our dataset contains known regulators of endosome functions including small  GTPases, SNAREs, and tethering complexes. We identify known cargo proteins such  as PIN3, PEN3, CESA, and the recently defined TPLATE complex. The subcellular  localization of two GTPase regulators predicted from our enrichments was  validated using live-cell imaging. This is the first proteomic dataset to  discriminate between such highly overlapping endomembrane compartments in plants  and can be used as a general proteomic resource to predict the localization of  proteins and identify the components of regulatory complexes and provides a  useful tool for the identification of new protein markers of the endomembrane  system.\n",

            "Cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) at the plasma membrane (PM) are aligned with  cortical microtubules (MTs) and direct the biosynthesis of cellulose. The  mechanism of the interaction between CSCs and MTs, and the cellular determinants  that control the delivery of CSCs at the PM, are not yet well understood. We  identified a unique small molecule, CESA TRAFFICKING INHIBITOR (CESTRIN), which  reduces cellulose content and alters the anisotropic growth of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) hypocotyls. We monitored the distribution and mobility of  fluorescently labeled cellulose synthases (CESAs) in live Arabidopsis cells under  chemical exposure to characterize their subcellular effects. CESTRIN reduces the  velocity of PM CSCs and causes their accumulation in the cell cortex. The  CSC-associated proteins KORRIGAN1 (KOR1) and POM2/CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE  PROTEIN1 (CSI1) were differentially affected by CESTRIN treatment, indicating  different forms of association with the PM CSCs. KOR1 accumulated in bodies  similar to CESA; however, POM2/CSI1 dissociated into the cytoplasm. In addition,  MT stability was altered without direct inhibition of MT polymerization,  suggesting a feedback mechanism caused by cellulose interference. The selectivity  of CESTRIN was assessed using a variety of subcellular markers for which no  morphological effect was observed. The association of CESAs with vesicles  decorated by the trans-Golgi network-localized protein SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS61  (SYP61) was increased under CESTRIN treatment, implicating SYP61 compartments in  CESA trafficking. The properties of CESTRIN compared with known CESA inhibitors  afford unique avenues to study and understand the mechanism under which  PM-associated CSCs are maintained and interact with MTs and to dissect their  trafficking routes in etiolated hypocotyls.\n",

            "The oriented deposition of cellulose microfibrils in the plant cell wall plays a  crucial role in various plant functions such as cell growth, organ formation and  defense responses. Cellulose is synthesized by cellulose synthase complexes  (CSCs) embedded in the plasma membrane (PM), which comprise the cellulose  synthases (CESAs). The abundance and localization of CSCs at the PM should be  strictly controlled for precise regulation of cellulose deposition, which  strongly depends on the membrane trafficking system. However, the mechanism of  the intracellular transport of CSCs is still poorly understood. In this study, we  explored requirements for phosphoinositides (PIs) in CESA trafficking by  analyzing the effects of inhibitors of PI synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana  expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged CESA3 (GFP-CESA3). We found that a  shift to a sucrose-free condition accelerated re-localization of PM-localized  GFP-CESA3 into the periphery of the Golgi apparatus via the clathrin-enriched  trans-Golgi network (TGN). Treatment with wortmannin (Wm), an inhibitor of  phosphatidylinositol 3- (PI3K) and 4- (PI4K) kinases, and phenylarsine oxide  (PAO), a more specific inhibitor for PI4K, inhibited internalization of GFP-CESA3  from the PM. In contrast, treatment with LY294002, which impairs the PI3K  activity, did not exert such an inhibitory effect on the sequestration of  GFP-CESA3, but caused a predominant accumulation of GFP-CESA3 at the ring-shaped  periphery of the Golgi apparatus, resulting in the removal of GFP-CESA3 from the  PM. These results indicate that PIs are essential elements for localization and  intracellular transport of CESA3 and that PI4K and PI3K are required for distinct  steps in secretory and/or endocytic trafficking of CESA3.\n",

            "Cellulose is the most abundant renewable polymer on Earth and a major component  of the plant cell wall. In vascular plants, cellulose synthesis is catalyzed by a  large, plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthase complex (CSC), visualized as  a hexameric rosette structure. Three unique cellulose synthase (CESA) isoforms  are required for CSC assembly and function. However, elucidation of either the  number or stoichiometry of CESAs within the CSC has remained elusive. In this  study, we show a 1:1:1 stoichiometry between the three Arabidopsis thaliana  secondary cell wall isozymes: CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. This ratio was determined  utilizing a simple but elegant method of quantitative immunoblotting using  isoform-specific antibodies and (35)S-labeled protein standards for each CESA.  Additionally, the observed equimolar stoichiometry was found to be fixed along  the axis of the stem, which represents a developmental gradient. Our results  complement recent spectroscopic analyses pointing toward an 18-chain cellulose  microfibril. Taken together, we propose that the CSC is composed of a hexamer of  catalytically active CESA trimers, with each CESA in equimolar amounts. This  finding is a crucial advance in understanding how CESAs integrate to form higher  order complexes, which is a key determinate of cellulose microfibril and cell  wall properties.\n",

It is  thought that the rosette complexes in the primary and secondary cell walls each  contains at least three different non-redundant cellulose synthases. In addition  to the CESA proteins, cellulose biosynthesis almost certainly requires the action  of other proteins, although few have been identified and little is known about  the biochemical role of those that have been identified. One of these proteins is  KORRIGAN (KOR1). Mutant analysis of this protein in Arabidopsis thaliana showed  altered cellulose content in both the primary and secondary cell wall. KOR1 is  thought to be required for cellulose synthesis acting as a cellulase at the  plasma membrane-cell wall interface. KOR1 has recently been shown to interact  with the primary cellulose synthase rosette complex however direct interaction  with that of the secondary cell wall has never been demonstrated. Using various  methods, both in vitro and in planta, it was shown that KOR1 interacts  specifically with only two of the secondary CESA proteins. The KOR1 protein  domain(s) involved in the interaction with the CESA proteins were also identified  by analyzing the interaction of truncated forms of KOR1 with CESA proteins.

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana), functional cellulose synthesis complexes (CSCs) are composed of at  least three different cellulose synthase catalytic subunits (CESAs), but the  actual ratio of the CESA isoforms within the CSCs remains unresolved. In this  work, the stoichiometry of the CESAs in the primary cell wall CSC was determined,  after elimination of CESA redundancy in a mutant background, by  coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry using label-free quantitative  methods. Based on spectral counting, we show that CESA1, CESA3, and CESA6 are  present in a 1:1:1 molecular ratio.\n",

            "The beta-1,4-glucan chains comprising cellulose are synthesized by cellulose  synthases in the plasma membranes of diverse organisms including bacteria and  plants. Understanding structure-function relationships in the plant enzymes  involved in cellulose synthesis (CESAs) is important because cellulose is the  most abundant component in the plant cell wall, a key renewable biomaterial.  Here, we explored the structure and function of the region encompassing  transmembrane helices (TMHs) 5 and 6 in CESA using computational and genetic  tools. Ab initio computational structure prediction revealed novel bi-modal  structural conformations of the region between TMH5 and 6 that may affect CESA  function. Here we present our computational findings on this region in three  CESAs of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCESA1, 3, and 6), the Atcesa3(ixr1-2) mutant,  and a novel missense mutation in AtCESA1. A newly engineered point mutation in  AtCESA1 (Atcesa1(F954L) ) that altered the structural conformation in silico  resulted in a protein that was not fully functional in the temperature-sensitive  Atcesa1(rsw1-1) mutant at the restrictive temperature.

            "The constituents of large, multisubunit protein complexes dictate their functions  in cells, but determining their precise molecular makeup in vivo is challenging.  One example of such a complex is the cellulose synthesis complex (CSC), which in  plants synthesizes cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. In growing  plant cells, CSCs exist in the plasma membrane as six-lobed rosettes that contain  at least three different cellulose synthase (CESA) isoforms, but the number and  stoichiometry of CESAs in each CSC are unknown. To begin to address this  question, we performed quantitative photobleaching of GFP-tagged  AtCESA3-containing particles in living Arabidopsis thaliana cells using  variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy and developed a set of  information-based step detection procedures to estimate the number of GFP  molecules in each particle. The step detection algorithms account for changes in  signal variance due to changing numbers of fluorophores, and the subsequent  analysis avoids common problems associated with fitting multiple Gaussian  functions to binned histogram data. The analysis indicates that at least 10  GFP-AtCESA3 molecules can exist in each particle. These procedures can be applied  to photobleaching data for any protein complex with large numbers of  fluorescently tagged subunits, providing a new analytical tool with which to  probe complex composition and stoichiometry.\n",

            "Cellulose biosynthesis is a common feature of land plants. Therefore, cellulose  biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs) have a potentially broad-acting herbicidal mode of  action and are also useful tools in decoding fundamental aspects of cellulose  biosynthesis. Here, we characterize the herbicide indaziflam as a CBI and provide  insight into its inhibitory mechanism. Indaziflam-treated seedlings exhibited the  CBI-like symptomologies of radial swelling and ectopic lignification.  Furthermore, indaziflam inhibited the production of cellulose within <1 h of  treatment and in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike the CBI isoxaben, indaziflam had  strong CBI activity in both a monocotylonous plant (Poa annua) and a  dicotyledonous plant (Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana]). Arabidopsis mutants  resistant to known CBIs isoxaben or quinoxyphen were not cross resistant to  indaziflam, suggesting a different molecular target for indaziflam. To explore  this further, we monitored the distribution and mobility of fluorescently labeled  CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins in living cells of Arabidopsis during  indaziflam exposure. Indaziflam caused a reduction in the velocity of YELLOW  FLUORESCENT PROTEIN:CESA6 particles at the plasma membrane focal plane compared  with controls. Microtubule morphology and motility were not altered after  indaziflam treatment. In the hypocotyl expansion zone, indaziflam caused an  atypical increase in the density of plasma membrane-localized CESA particles.  Interestingly, this was accompanied by a cellulose synthase  interacting1-independent reduction in the normal coincidence rate between  microtubules and CESA particles. As a CBI, for which there is little evidence of  evolved weed resistance, indaziflam represents an important addition to the  action mechanisms available for weed management.\n",

            "In higher plants, cellulose is synthesized by plasma membrane-localized cellulose  synthase complexes (CSCs). Arabidopsis thaliana GH9A1/KORRIGAN1 is a  membrane-bound, family 9 glycosyl hydrolase that is important for cellulose  synthesis in both primary and secondary cell walls. Most previously identified  korrigan1 mutants show severe phenotypes such as embryo lethality; therefore, the  role of GH9A1 in cellulose synthesis remains unclear. Here, we report a novel  A577V missense mutation, designated jiaoyao1 (jia1), in the second of the  glycosyl hydrolase family 9 active site signature motifs in GH9A1. jia1 is  defective in cell expansion in dark-grown hypocotyls, roots, and adult plants.  Consistent with its defect in cell expansion, this mutation in GH9A1 resulted in  reduced cellulose content and reduced CSC velocity at the plasma membrane. Green  fluorescent protein-GH9A1 is associated with CSCs at multiple locations,  including the plasma membrane, Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and small  CESA-containing compartments or microtubule-associated cellulose synthase  compartments, indicating a tight association between GH9A1 and CSCs. GH9A1(A577V)  abolishes the endoglucanase activity of GH9A1 in vitro but does not affect its  interaction with CESAs in vitro, suggesting that endoglucanase activity is  important for cellulose synthesis. Interestingly, jia1 results in both cellulose  microfibril and microtubule disorganization.

The present study was designed to examine the  improved enzymatic saccharification efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass of  tobacco plants expressing AtCESA3ixr1-2. Three-month-old AtCESA3ixr1-2 transgenic  and wild-type tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. variety Samsun NN) were grown  in the presence and absence of isoxaben. Biomass obtained from leaf, stem, and  root tissues were analyzed for enzymatic saccharification rates. During enzymatic  saccharification, 45% and 25% more sugar was released from transgenic leaf and  stem samples, respectively, when compared to the wild-type samples. This gain in  saccharification efficiency was achieved without chemical or heat pretreatment.  Additionally, leaf and stem biomass from transgenic AtCESA3ixr1-2 requires a  reduced amount of enzyme for saccharification compared to biomass from wild-type  plants. From a practical standpoint, a similar strategy could be employed to  introduce the mutated CESA into energy crops like poplar and switchgrass to  improve the efficiency of biomass conversion.\n",

            "In plants, cellulose biosynthesis is an essential process for anisotropic growth  and therefore is an ideal target for inhibition. Based on the documented utility  of small-molecule inhibitors to dissect complex cellular processes we identified  a cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor (CBI), named acetobixan, by bio-prospecting  among compounds secreted by endophytic microorganisms. Acetobixan was identified  using a drug-gene interaction screen to sift through hundreds of endophytic  microbial secretions for one that caused synergistic reduction in root expansion  of the leaky AtcesA6prc1-1 mutant. We then mined this microbial secretion for  compounds that were differentially abundant compared with Bacilli that failed to  mimic CBI action to isolate a lead pharmacophore. Analogs of this lead compound  were screened for CBI activity, and the most potent analog was named acetobixan.  In living Arabidopsis cells visualized by confocal microscopy, acetobixan  treatment caused CESA particles localized at the plasma membrane (PM) to rapidly  re-localize to cytoplasmic vesicles. Acetobixan inhibited 14C-Glc uptake into  crystalline cellulose. Moreover, cortical microtubule dynamics were not disrupted  by acetobixan, suggesting specific activity towards cellulose synthesis. Previous  CBI resistant mutants such as ixr1-2, ixr2-1 or aegeus were not cross resistant  to acetobixan indicating that acetobixan targets a different aspect of cellulose  biosynthesis.\n",

            "During cytokinesis a new crosswall is rapidly laid down. This process involves  the formation at the cell equator of a tubulo-vesicular membrane network (TVN).  This TVN evolves into a tubular network (TN) and a planar fenestrated sheet,  which extends at its periphery before fusing to the mother cell wall. The role of  cell wall polymers in cell plate assembly is poorly understood. We used specific  stains and GFP-labelled cellulose synthases (CESAs) to show that cellulose, as  well as three distinct CESAs, accumulated in the cell plate already at the TVN  stage. This early presence suggests that cellulose is extruded into the tubular  membrane structures of the TVN. Co-localisation studies using GFP-CESAs suggest  the delivery of cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) to the cell plate via  phragmoplast-associated vesicles. In the more mature TN part of the cell plate,  we observed delivery of GFP-CESA from doughnut-shaped organelles, presumably  Golgi bodies. During the conversion of the TN into a planar fenestrated sheet,  the GFP-CESA density diminished, whereas GFP-CESA levels remained high in the TVN  zone at the periphery of the expanding cell plate. We observed retrieval of  GFP-CESA in clathrin-containing structures from the central zone of the cell  plate and from the plasma membrane of the mother cell, which may contribute to  the recycling of CESAs to the peripheral growth zone of the cell plate. These  observations, together with mutant phenotypes of cellulose-deficient mutants and  pharmacological experiments, suggest a key role for cellulose synthesis already  at early stages of cell plate assembly.\n",

CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins  function as catalytic subunits of a rosette-shaped complex that synthesizes  cellulose at the plasma membrane. Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa)  secondary wall CESA loss-of-function mutants have weak stems and irregular or  thin cell walls. RESULTS: Here, we identify candidates for secondary wall CESAs  in Brachypodium distachyon as having similar amino acid sequence and expression  to those characterized in A. thaliana, namely CESA4/7/8. To functionally  characterize BdCESA4 and BdCESA7, we generated loss-of-function mutants using  artificial microRNA constructs, specifically targeting each gene driven by a  maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter. Presence of the transgenes reduced BdCESA4  and BdCESA7 transcript abundance, as well as stem area, cell wall thickness of  xylem and fibers, and the amount of crystalline cellulose in the cell wall.

            "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the best-characterized type of endocytosis  in eukaryotic cells. Plants appear to possess all of the molecular components  necessary to carry out CME; however, functional characterization of the  components is still in its infancy. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified mu2 as a  putative interaction partner of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE6 (CESA6). Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) mu2 is homologous to the medium subunit 2 of the mammalian  ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX2 (AP2). In mammals, the AP2 complex acts as the central  hub of CME by docking to the plasma membrane while concomitantly recruiting cargo  proteins, clathrin triskelia, and accessory proteins to the sites of endocytosis.  We confirmed that mu2 interacts with multiple CESA proteins through the mu-homology  domain of mu2, which is involved in specific interactions with endocytic cargo  proteins in mammals. Consistent with its role in mediating the endocytosis of  cargos at the plasma membrane, mu2-YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN localized to  transient foci at the plasma membrane, and loss of mu2 resulted in defects in bulk  endocytosis. Furthermore, loss of mu2 led to increased accumulation of YELLOW  FLUORESCENT PROTEIN-CESA6 particles at the plasma membrane.

Here we characterized two poplar cellulose synthase-like D  (CSLD) genes, PdCSLD5 and PdCSLD6, the most probable orthologs to the Arabidopsis  AtCSLD3/KOJAK gene. Both PdCSLD5 and PdCSLD6 are strongly expressed in roots,  including in the root hairs. Subcellular localization experiments showed that  these two proteins are located not only in the polarized plasma membrane of root  hair tips, but also in Golgi apparatus of the root hair and non-hair-forming  cells. Overexpression of these two poplar genes in the atcsld3 mutant was able to  rescue most of the defects caused by disruption of AtCSLD3, including root hair  morphological changes, altered cell wall monosaccharide composition, increased  non-crystalline beta-1,4-glucan and decreased crystalline cellulose contents. Taken  together, our results provide evidence indicating that PdCSLD5 and PdCSLD6 are  functionally conserved with AtCSLD3 and support a role for PdCSLD5 and PdCSL6  specifically in crystalline cellulose production in poplar root hair tips.

In Arabidopsis  thaliana, the cellulose biosynthesis in the secondary walls is catalyzed by three  cellulose synthases CESA4, CESA7 and CESA8. The transcription factor MYB46 and  its close homolog MYB83 directly regulate the expression of the three secondary  wall cellulose synthases (CESAs). However, it is not known whether MYB46 is the  necessary regulator for functional expression of the secondary wall CESAs or one  of the multiple transcriptional factors involved in the transcriptional  regulatory program. To address this question, we used a series of genetic  complementation experiments of the cesa knock-out mutants with the CESA coding  sequence driven by either native- or mutated promoter of the genes. The mutant  promoters have two nucleotide point mutations in the MYB46 binding cis element  (M46RE) such that MYB46 cannot bind to the promoter, while the binding of other  known secondary wall transcription factors is not affected. The mutant  complementation results showed that MYB46 is essential to restore normal  phenotype from the cesa mutants.

This is largely controlled by cortical microtubules,  which drive the insertion and trajectory of the cellulose synthase (CESA) complex  at the plasma membrane. The CESA interactive protein 1 (CSI1) acts as a physical  linker between CESA and cortical microtubules. Here we show that the  inflorescence stems of csi1 mutants exhibit subtle right-handed torsion. Because  cellulose deposition is largely uncoupled from cortical microtubules in csi1, we  hypothesize that strictly transverse deposition of microfibrils in the wild-type  is replaced by a helical orientation of uniform handedness in the mutant and that  the helical microfibril alignment generates torsion. Interestingly, both elastic  and viscous models for an expanding cell predict that a net helical orientation  of microfibrils gives rise to a torque. We indeed observed tilted microfibrils in  csi1 cells, and the torsion was almost absent in a csi1 prc1 background with  impaired cellulose synthesis. In addition, the stem torsion led to a novel  bimodal and robust phyllotactic pattern in the csi1 mutant, illustrating how  growth perturbations can replace one robust mathematical pattern with a  different, equally robust pattern.\n",

In organisms with cell walls, the wall acts as a primary  constraint of shape, and generation of specific cell shape depends on  cytoskeletal organization for wall deposition and/or cell expansion. In higher  plants, cortical microtubules help to organize cell wall construction by  positioning the delivery of cellulose synthase (CesA) complexes and guiding their  trajectories to orient newly synthesized cellulose microfibrils. The actin  cytoskeleton is required for normal distribution of CesAs to the plasma membrane,  but more specific roles for actin in cell wall assembly and organization remain  largely elusive. We show that the actin cytoskeleton functions to regulate the  CesA delivery rate to, and lifetime of CesAs at, the plasma membrane, which  affects cellulose production. Furthermore, quantitative image analyses revealed  that actin organization affects CesA tracking behavior at the plasma membrane and  that small CesA compartments were associated with the actin cytoskeleton. By  contrast, localized insertion of CesAs adjacent to cortical microtubules was not  affected by the actin organization. Hence, both actin and microtubule  cytoskeletons play important roles in regulating CesA trafficking, cellulose  deposition, and organization of cell wall biogenesis.\n",

Extending beyond the cross-kingdom similarities related to  cellulose polymerization, the predicted structure of cotton CESA reveals that  plant-specific modules (plant-conserved region and class-specific region) fold  into distinct subdomains on the periphery of the catalytic region. Computational  results support the importance of the plant-conserved region and/or  class-specific region in CESA oligomerization to form the multimeric  cellulose-synthesis complexes that are characteristic of plants. Relatively high  sequence conservation between plant CESAs allowed mapping of known mutations and  two previously undescribed mutations that perturb cellulose synthesis in  Arabidopsis thaliana to their analogous positions in the modeled structure. Most  of these mutation sites are near the predicted catalytic region, and the  confluence of other mutation sites supports the existence of previously undefined  functional nodes within the catalytic core of CESA. Overall, the predicted  tertiary structure provides a platform for the biochemical engineering of plant  CESAs.\n",

            "Multiple cellulose synthase (CesA) subunits assemble into plasma membrane  complexes responsible for cellulose production. In the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) model system, we identified a novel D604N missense mutation, designated  anisotropy1 (any1), in the essential primary cell wall CesA1. Most previously  identified CesA1 mutants show severe constitutive or conditional phenotypes such  as embryo lethality or arrest of cellulose production but any1 plants are viable  and produce seeds, thus permitting the study of CesA1 function. The dwarf mutants  have reduced anisotropic growth of roots, aerial organs, and trichomes.  Interestingly, cellulose microfibrils were disordered only in the epidermal cells  of the any1 inflorescence stem, whereas they were transverse to the growth axis  in other tissues of the stem and in all elongated cell types of roots and  dark-grown hypocotyls. Overall cellulose content was not altered but both cell  wall crystallinity and the velocity of cellulose synthase complexes were reduced  in any1. We crossed any1 with the temperature-sensitive radial swelling1-1  (rsw1-1) CesA1 mutant and observed partial complementation of the any1 phenotype  in the transheterozygotes at rsw1-1's permissive temperature (21 degrees C) and full  complementation by any1 of the conditional rsw1-1 root swelling phenotype at the  restrictive temperature (29 degrees C). In rsw1-1 homozygotes at restrictive temperature,  a striking dissociation of cellulose synthase complexes from the plasma membrane  was accompanied by greatly diminished motility of intracellular cellulose  synthase-containing compartments. Neither phenomenon was observed in the any1  rsw1-1 transheterozygotes, suggesting that the proteins encoded by the any1  allele replace those encoded by rsw1-1 at restrictive temperature.\n",

            "Manipulation of the cellulose biosynthetic machinery in plants has the potential  to provide insight into plant growth, morphogenesis and to create modified  cellulose for anthropogenic use. Evidence exists that cellulose microfibril  structure and its recalcitrance to enzymatic digestion can ameliorated via  mis-sense mutation in the primary cell wall-specific gene AtCELLULOSE SYNTHASE  (CESA)3. This mis-sense mutation has been identified based on conferring drug  resistance to the cellulose inhibitory herbicide isoxaben. To examine whether it  would be possible to introduce mutant CESA alleles via a transgenic approach, we  overexpressed a modified version of CESA3, AtCESA3(ixr1-2) derived from  Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh into a different plant family, the Solanceae  dicotyledon tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. variety Samsun NN). Specifically, a  chimeric gene construct of CESA3(ixr1-2) , codon optimized for tobacco, was  placed between the heterologous M24 promoter and the rbcSE9 gene terminator. The  results demonstrated that the tobacco plants expressing M24-CESA3(ixr1-2)  displayed isoxaben resistance, consistent with functionality of the mutated  AtCESA3(ixr1-2) in tobacco. Secondly, during enzymatic saccharification,  transgenic leaf- and stem-derived cellulose is 54%-66% and 40%-51% more  efficient, respectively, compared to the wild type, illustrating translational  potential of modified CESA loci. Moreover, the introduction of  M24-AtCESA3(ixr1-2) caused aberrant spatial distribution of lignified secondary  cell wall tissue and a reduction in the zone occupied by parenchyma cells.\n",

These CESA genes are considered secondary cell wall  CESAs. The others (the function CESA10 is still unknown) are thought to be  specialized for cellulose synthesis in the primary cell wall. A split-ubiquitin  membrane yeast two-hybrid system was used to assess interactions among four  primary CESAs (CESA1, CESA2, CESA3, CESA6) and three secondary CESAs (CESA4,  CESA7, CESA8). Our results showed that primary CESAs could physically interact  with secondary CESAs in a limited fashion. Analysis of transgenic lines showed  that CESA1 could partially rescue irx1(cesa8) null mutants, resulting in  complementation of the plant growth defect, collapsed xylem and cellulose content  deficiency.

            "Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. Three cellulose synthases  (CESA4, CESA7 and CESA8) are necessary for cellulose production in the secondary  cell walls of Arabidopsis. Little is known about how expression of these CESA  genes is regulated. We recently identified a cis-regulatory element (M46RE) that  is recognized by MYB46, which is a master switch for secondary wall formation in  Arabidopsis. A genome-wide survey of promoter sequences for the presence of  M46REs led to the hypothesis that MYB46 may function as a direct regulator of all  three secondary wall-associated cellulose synthase genes: CESA4, CESA7 and CESA8.  We tested this hypothesis using several lines of experimental evidence. All three  CESA genes are highly up-regulated by both constitutive and inducible  over-expression of MYB46 in planta. Using a steroid receptor-based inducible  activation system, we show that MYB46 directly activates transcription of the  three CESA genes. We then used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and  chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis to confirm that MYB46 protein directly  binds to the promoters of the three CESA genes both in vitro and in vivo.  Furthermore, ectopic up-regulation of MYB46 resulted in a significant increase of  crystalline cellulose content in Arabidopsis. Taken together, we have identified  MYB46 as a transcription factor that directly regulates all three secondary  wall-associated CESA genes. Yeast one-hybrid screening identified additional  transcription factors that regulate the CESA genes. However, none of the putative  regulators appears to be regulated by MYB46, suggesting the multi-faceted nature  of transcriptional regulation of secondary wall cellulose biosynthesis.\n",

            "Cellulose synthase (CESA), which is an essential catalyst for the generation of  plant cell wall biomass, is mainly encoded by the CesA gene family that contains  ten or more members. In this study; four full-length cDNAs encoding CESA were  isolated from Betula platyphylla Suk., which is an important timber species,  using RT-PCR combined with the RACE method and were named as BplCesA3, -4, -7 and  -8. These deduced CESAs contained the same typical domains and regions as their  Arabidopsis homologs. The cDNA lengths differed among these four genes, as did  the locations of the various protein domains inferred from the deduced amino acid  sequences, which shared amino acid sequence identities ranging from only 63.8% to  70.5%. Real-time RT-PCR showed that all four BplCesAs were expressed at different  levels in diverse tissues. Results indicated that BplCESA8 might be involved in  secondary cell wall biosynthesis and floral development. BplCESA3 appeared in a  unique expression pattern and was possibly involved in primary cell wall  biosynthesis and seed development; it might also be related to the  homogalacturonan synthesis. BplCESA7 and BplCESA4 may be related to the formation  of a cellulose synthase complex and participate mainly in secondary cell wall  biosynthesis. The extremely low expression abundance of the four BplCESAs in  mature pollen suggested very little involvement of them in mature pollen  formation in Betula. The distinct expression pattern of the four BplCesAs  suggested they might participate in developments of various tissues and that they  are possibly controlled by distinct mechanisms in Betula.\n",

            "The increasing focus on plantation forestry as a renewable source of cellulosic  biomass has emphasized the need for tools to study the unique biology of woody  genera such as Eucalyptus, Populus and Pinus. The domestication of these woody  crops is hampered by long generation times, and breeders are now looking to  molecular approaches such as marker-assisted breeding and genetic modification to  accelerate tree improvement. Much of what is known about genes involved in the  growth and development of plants has come from studies of herbaceous models such  as Arabidopsis and rice. However, transferring this information to woody plants  often proves difficult, especially for genes expressed in woody stems. Here we  report the use of induced somatic sector analysis (ISSA) for characterization of  promoter expression patterns directly in the stems of Populus and Eucalyptus  trees. As a case study, we used previously characterized primary and secondary  cell wall-related cellulose synthase (CesA) promoters cloned from Eucalyptus  grandis. We show that ISSA can be used to elucidate the phloem and xylem  expression patterns of the CesA genes in Eucalyptus and Populus stems and also  show that the staining patterns differ in Eucalyptus and Populus stems. These  findings show that ISSA is an efficient approach to investigate promoter function  in the developmental context of woody plant tissues and raise questions about the  suitability of heterologous promoters for genetic manipulation in plant species.\n",

Overexpression of an altered PtdCesA8A  cDNA encoding a PtdCesA8A protein missing one methionine at the N-terminus (1M)  in aspen resulted in substantial decrease in cellulose content and caused  negative effects on wood strength, suggesting that both methionines are essential  for proper CesA expression and function in developing xylem tissues. Transcripts  from a pair of paralogous native PtdCesA8 genes, as well as introduced  PtdCesA8A:1M transgenes were significantly reduced in developing xylem tissues of  transgenic aspen plants, suggestive of a co-suppression event. Overexpression of  a native PtdCesA8A cDNA encoding a CesA protein with 2Ms at the N-terminus did  not cause any such phenotypic changes.

            "Cellulose synthase (CesA) genes constitute a complex multigene family with six  major phylogenetic clades in angiosperms. The recently sequenced genome of  domestic apple, Malusxdomestica, was mined for CesA genes, by blasting  full-length cellulose synthase protein (CESA) sequences annotated in the apple  genome against protein databases from the plant models Arabidopsis thaliana and  Populus trichocarpa. Thirteen genes belonging to the six angiosperm CesA clades  and coding for proteins with conserved residues typical of processive  glycosyltransferases from family 2 were detected. Based on their phylogenetic  relationship to Arabidopsis CESAs, as well as expression patterns, a nomenclature  is proposed to facilitate further studies. Examination of their genomic  organization revealed that MdCesA8-A is closely linked and co-oriented with  WDR53, a gene coding for a WD40 repeat protein. The WDR53 and CesA8 genes display  conserved collinearity in dicots and are partially co-expressed in the apple  xylem. Interestingly, the presence of a bicistronic WDR53-CesA8A transcript was  detected in phytoplasma-infected phloem tissues of apple. The bicistronic  transcript contains a spliced intergenic sequence that is predicted to fold into  hairpin structures typical of internal ribosome entry sites, suggesting its  potential cap-independent translation. Surprisingly, the CesA8A cistron is  alternatively spliced and lacks the zinc-binding domain.

            "In higher plants, cellulose is synthesized by so-called rosette protein complexes  with cellulose synthases (CESAs) as catalytic subunits of the complex. The CESAs  are divided into two distinct families, three of which are thought to be  specialized for the primary cell wall and three for the secondary cell wall. In  this article, the potential of primary and secondary CESAs forming a functional  rosette complex has been investigated. The membrane-based yeast two-hybrid and  biomolecular fluorescence systems were used to assess the interactions between  three primary (CESA1, CESA3, CESA6), and three secondary (CESA4, CESA7, CESA8)  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CESAs. The results showed that all primary  CESAs can physically interact both in vitro and in planta with all secondary  CESAs. Although CESAs are broadly capable of interacting in pairwise  combinations, they are not all able to form functional complexes in planta.  Analysis of transgenic lines showed that CESA7 can partially rescue defects in  the primary cell wall biosynthesis in a weak cesa3 mutant. Green fluorescent  protein-CESA protein fusions revealed that when CESA3 was replaced by CESA7 in  the primary rosette, the velocity of the mixed complexes was slightly faster than  the native primary complexes. CESA1 in turn can partly rescue defects in  secondary cell wall biosynthesis in a cesa8ko mutant, resulting in an increase of  cellulose content relative to cesa8ko. These results demonstrate that sufficient  parallels exist between the primary and secondary complexes for  cross-functionality and open the possibility that mixed complexes of primary and  secondary CESAs may occur at particular times.\n",

            "Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by protein complexes known as  cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs). The cellulose-microtubule alignment  hypothesis states that there is a causal link between the orientation of cortical  microtubules and orientation of nascent cellulose microfibrils. The mechanism  behind the alignment hypothesis is largely unknown. CESA interactive protein 1  (CSI1) interacts with CSCs and potentially links CSCs to the cytoskeleton. CSI1  not only co-localizes with CSCs but also travels bi-directionally in a speed  indistinguishable from CSCs. The linear trajectories of CSI1-RFP coincide with  the underlying microtubules labeled by YFP-TUA5. In the absence of CSI1, both the  distribution and the motility of CSCs are defective and the alignment of CSCs and  microtubules is disrupted. These observations led to the hypothesis that CSI1  directly mediates the interaction between CSCs and microtubules. In support of  this hypothesis, CSI1 binds to microtubules directly by an in vitro  microtubule-binding assay. In addition to a role in serving as a messenger from  microtubule to CSCs, CSI1 labels SmaCCs/MASCs, a compartment that has been  proposed to be involved in CESA trafficking and/or delivery to the plasma  membrane.\n",

            "The mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of cellulose in plants are complex and  still poorly understood. A central question concerns the mechanism of microfibril  structure and how this is linked to the catalytic polymerization action of  cellulose synthase (CESA). Furthermore, it remains unclear whether modification  of cellulose microfibril structure can be achieved genetically, which could be  transformative in a bio-based economy. To explore these processes in planta, we  developed a chemical genetic toolbox of pharmacological inhibitors and  corresponding resistance-conferring point mutations in the C-terminal  transmembrane domain region of CESA1(A903V) and CESA3(T942I) in Arabidopsis  thaliana. Using (13)C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and  X-ray diffraction, we show that the cellulose microfibrils displayed reduced  width and an additional cellulose C4 peak indicative of a degree of crystallinity  that is intermediate between the surface and interior glucans of wild type,  suggesting a difference in glucan chain association during microfibril formation.  Consistent with measurements of lower microfibril crystallinity, cellulose  extracts from mutated CESA1(A903V) and CESA3(T942I) displayed greater  saccharification efficiency than wild type. Using live-cell imaging to track  fluorescently labeled CESA, we found that these mutants show increased CESA  velocities in the plasma membrane, an indication of increased polymerization  rate. Collectively, these data suggest that CESA1(A903V) and CESA3(T942I) have  modified microfibril structure in terms of crystallinity and suggest that in  plants, as in bacteria, crystallization biophysically limits polymerization.\n",

Cellulose consists of beta-1,4-linked glucan chains assembled  into paracrystalline microfibrils that are synthesized by plasma membrane-located  cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes. Associations with hemicelluloses are  important for microfibril spacing and for maintaining cell wall tensile strength.  Several components associated with cellulose synthesis have been identified;  however, the biological functions for many of them remain elusive. We show that  the chitinase-like (CTL) proteins, CTL1/POM1 and CTL2, are functionally  equivalent, affect cellulose biosynthesis, and are likely to play a key role in  establishing interactions between cellulose microfibrils and hemicelluloses.  CTL1/POM1 coincided with CESAs in the endomembrane system and was secreted to the  apoplast. The movement of CESAs was compromised in ctl1/pom1 mutant seedlings,  and the cellulose content and xyloglucan structures were altered. X-ray analysis  revealed reduced crystalline cellulose content in ctl1 ctl2 double mutants,  suggesting that the CTLs cooperatively affect assembly of the glucan chains,  which may affect interactions between hemicelluloses and cellulose. Consistent  with this hypothesis, both CTLs bound glucan-based polymers in vitro. We propose  that the apoplastic CTLs regulate cellulose assembly and interaction with  hemicelluloses via binding to emerging cellulose microfibrils.\n",

            "The transcriptome of the developing starchy endosperm of hexaploid wheat  (Triticum aestivum) was determined using RNA-Seq isolated at five stages during  grain fill. This resource represents an excellent way to identify candidate genes  responsible for the starchy endosperm cell wall, which is dominated by  arabinoxylan (AX), accounting for 70% of the cell wall polysaccharides, with 20%  (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucan, 7% glucomannan, and 4% cellulose. A complete inventory of  transcripts of 124 glycosyltransferase (GT) and 72 glycosylhydrolase (GH) genes  associated with cell walls is presented. The most highly expressed GT transcript  (excluding those known to be involved in starch synthesis) was a GT47 family  transcript similar to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) IRX10 involved in xylan  extension, and the second most abundant was a GT61. Profiles for GT43 IRX9 and  IRX14 putative orthologs were consistent with roles in AX synthesis. Low  abundances were found for transcripts from genes in the acyl-coA transferase BAHD  family, for which a role in AX feruloylation has been postulated. The relative  expression of these was much greater in whole grain compared with starchy  endosperm, correlating with the levels of bound ferulate. Transcripts associated  with callose (GSL), cellulose (CESA), pectin (GAUT), and glucomannan (CSLA)  synthesis were also abundant in starchy endosperm, while the corresponding cell  wall polysaccharides were confirmed as low abundance (glucomannan and callose) or  undetectable (pectin) in these samples. Abundant transcripts from GH families  associated with the hydrolysis of these polysaccharides were also present,  suggesting that they may be rapidly turned over. Abundant transcripts in the GT31  family may be responsible for the addition of Gal residues to arabinogalactan  peptide.\n",

The primary load-bearing macromolecule of a plant cell wall is cellulose, which  forms crystalline microfibrils that are organized with respect to a cell's  function and shape requirements. A primary cell wall is deposited during  expansion whereas secondary cell wall is synthesized post expansion during  differentiation. A complex form of asymmetrical cellular differentiation occurs  in Arabidopsis seed coat epidermal cells, where we have recently shown that two  secondary cell wall processes occur that utilize different cellulose synthase  (CESA) proteins. One process is to produce pectinaceous mucilage that expands  upon hydration and the other is a radial wall thickening that reinforced the  epidermal cell structure. Our data illustrate polarized specialization of CESA5  in facilitating mucilage attachment to the parent seed and CESA2, CESA5 and CESA9  in radial cell wall thickening and formation of the columella. Herein, we present  a model for the complexity of cellulose biosynthesis in this highly  differentiated cell type with further evidence supporting each cellulosic  secondary cell wall process.\n",

            "Plant development is highly plastic and dependent on light quantity and quality  monitored by specific photoreceptors. Although we have a detailed knowledge of  light signaling pathways, little is known about downstream targets involved in  growth control. Cell size and shape are in part controlled by cellulose  microfibrils extruded from large cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) that migrate  in the plasma membrane along cortical microtubules. Here we show a role for the  red/far-red light photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB) in the regulation of  cellulose synthesis in the growing Arabidopsis hypocotyl. In this organ, CSCs  contains three distinct cellulose synthase (CESA) isoform classes: nonredundant  CESA1 and CESA3 and a third class represented by partially redundant CESA2,  CESA5, and CESA6. Interestingly, in the dark, depending on which CESA subunits  occupy the third position, CSC velocity is more or less inhibited through an  interaction with microtubules. Activation of PHYB overrules this inhibition. The  analysis of cesa5 mutants shows a role for phosphorylation in the control of CSC  velocity. These results, combined with the cesa5 mutant phenotype, suggest that  cellulose synthesis is fine tuned through the regulated interaction of CSCs with  microtubules and that PHYB signaling impinges on this process to maintain cell  wall strength and growth in changing environments.\n",

In root hairs, expansion occurs by a process  called tip growth, which is shared by root hairs, pollen tubes and fungal hyphae.  We show that cellulose-like polysaccharides are present in root-hair tips, and de  novo synthesis of these polysaccharides is required for tip growth. We also find  that eYFP-CSLD3 proteins, but not CESA cellulose synthases, localize to a  polarized plasma-membrane domain in root hairs. Using biochemical methods and  genetic complementation of a csld3 mutant with a chimaeric CSLD3 protein  containing a CESA6 catalytic domain, we provide evidence that CSLD3 represents a  distinct (1-->4)-beta-glucan synthase activity in apical plasma membranes during tip  growth in root-hair cells.\n",

            "Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) epidermal seed coat cells follow a complex  developmental program where, following fertilization, cells of the ovule outer  integument differentiate into a unique cell type. Two hallmarks of these cells  are the production of a doughnut-shaped apoplastic pocket filled with  pectinaceous mucilage and the columella, a thick secondary cell wall. Cellulose  is thought to be a key component of both these secondary cell wall processes.  Here, we investigated the role of cellulose synthase (CESA) subunits CESA2,  CESA5, and CESA9 in the seed coat epidermis. We characterized the roles of these  CESA proteins in the seed coat by analyzing cell wall composition and morphology  in cesa mutant lines. Mutations in any one of these three genes resulted in lower  cellulose content, a loss of cell shape uniformity, and reduced radial wall  integrity. In addition, we found that attachment of the mucilage halo to the  parent seed following extrusion is maintained by cellulose-based connections  requiring CESA5. Hence, we show that cellulose fulfills an adhesion role between  the extracellular mucilage matrix and the parent cell in seed coat epidermal  cells. We propose that mucilage remains attached to the seed coat through  interactions between components in the seed mucilage and cellulose. Our data  suggest that CESA2 and CESA9 serve in radial wall reinforcement, as does CESA5,  but CESA5 also functions in mucilage biosynthesis. These data suggest unique  roles for different CESA subunits in one cell type and illustrate a complex role  for cellulose biosynthesis in plant developmental biology.\n",

            "The cell wall is a protective barrier of paramount importance for the survival of  plant cells. Monitoring the integrity of cell wall allows plants to quickly  activate defence pathways to minimize pathogen entry and reduce the spread of  disease. Counterintuitively, however, pharmacological effects as well as genetic  lesions that affect cellulose biosynthesis and content confer plants with  enhanced resistance against necrotrophic fungi. This kind of pathogens target  cellulose for degradation to facilitate penetration and to generate glucose units  as a food source. Our results points towards the existence of a transcriptional  reprogramming mechanism in genes encoding cellulose synthases (CesAs) that occurs  very soon after Botrytis cinerea attack and that results in a temporarily shut  down of some CesA genes. Interestingly, the observed coordinated down-regulation  of CesA genes is more pronounced, and occurs earlier, in myb46 mutant plants. In  the resistant myb46 plants, pathogen infection induces transient down-regulation  of CesA genes that concurs with a selective transcriptional reprogramming in a  set of genes encoding structural cell wall proteins and extracellular remodelling  enzymes. Together with previous indications, our results favour the hypothesis  that CesAs are part of a surveillance system of the cell wall integrity that  senses the presence of a pathogen and transduces that signal into a rapid  transcriptional reprogramming of the affected cell.\n",

            "The phytohormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), play important roles in regulating  cell elongation and cell size, and BR-related mutants in Arabidopsis display  significant dwarf phenotypes. Cellulose is a biopolymer which has a major  contribution to cell wall formation during cell expansion and elongation.  However, whether BRs regulate cellulose synthesis, and if so, what the underlying  mechanism of cell elongation induced by BRs is, is unknown. The content of  cellulose and the expression levels of the cellulose synthase genes (CESAs) was  measured in BR-related mutants and their wild-type counterpart. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation (CHIP) experiments and genetic analysis were used to  demonstrate that BRs regulate CESA genes. It was found here that the BR-deficient  or BR-perceptional mutants contain less cellulose than the wild type. The  expression of CESA genes, especially those related to primary cell wall  synthesis, was reduced in det2-1 and bri1-301, and was only inducible by BRs in  the BR-deficient mutant det2-1. CHIP experiments show that the BR-activated  transcription factor BES1 can associate with upstream elements of most CESA genes  particularly those related with the primary cell wall. Furthermore,  over-expression of the BR receptor BRI1 in CESA1, 3, and 6 mutants can only  partially rescue the dwarf phenotypes. Our findings provide potential insights  into the mechanism that BRs regulate cellulose synthesis to accomplish the cell  elongation process in plant development.\n",

However, fixation studies have  indicated that microtubules can be variably aligned across the epidermis of  elongating shoots. In addition, microtubules are reported to have different  orientations on inner and outer epidermal surfaces, undermining the idea of  hoop-reinforcement. Here, long-term movies of Arabidopsis seedlings expressing  GFP-TUA6 allowed microtubule alignment to be directly correlated with the rate of  elongation within individual growing cells. We also investigated whether  microtubule alignment at the inner or the outer epidermal wall better reflected  the growth rate. Movies confirmed that transverse microtubules form on the inner  wall throughout elongation, but orientation of microtubules is variable at the  outer wall, where they tend to become transverse only during episodes of  accelerated growth. Because this appears to contradict the concept that  circumferential arrays of transverse microtubules or microfibrils are essential  for cell elongation, we checked the organisation of cellulose synthase tracks  using GFP-CESA3 and found a similar mismatch between trajectories on inner and  outer epidermal surfaces. We conclude that microtubule alignment on the inner  wall appears to be a more stable predictor of growth anisotropy, whereas  outer-wall alignment is more sensitive to the elongation rate.\n",

Cellulose microfibrils constitute a major component  of both primary and secondary cell walls and are synthesized at the plasma  membrane by cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes. Several studies in Arabidopsis  have demonstrated the power of co-expression analyses to identify new genes  associated with secondary wall cellulose biosynthesis. However, across-species  comparative co-expression analyses remain largely unexplored. Here, we compared  co-expressed gene vicinity networks of primary and secondary wall CESAsin  Arabidopsis, barley, rice, poplar, soybean, Medicago, and wheat, and identified  gene families that are consistently co-regulated with cellulose biosynthesis. In  addition to the expected polysaccharide acting enzymes, we also found many gene  families associated with cytoskeleton, signaling, transcriptional regulation,  oxidation, and protein degradation. Based on these analyses, we selected and  biochemically analyzed T-DNA insertion lines corresponding to approximately  twenty genes from gene families that re-occur in the co-expressed gene vicinity  networks of secondary wall CESAs across the seven species. We developed a  statistical pipeline using principal component analysis and optimal clustering  based on silhouette width to analyze sugar profiles. One of the mutants,  corresponding to a pinoresinol reductase gene, displayed disturbed xylem  morphology and held lower levels of lignin molecules.

            "BACKGROUND: The cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like gene superfamily  (CESA/CSL) is proposed to encode enzymes for cellulose and non-cellulosic matrix  polysaccharide synthesis in plants. Although the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome  has been sequenced for a few years, the global expression profiling patterns and  functions of the OsCESA/CSL superfamily remain largely unknown. RESULTS: A total  of 45 identified members of OsCESA/CSL were classified into two clusters based on  phylogeny and motif constitution. Duplication events contributed largely to the  expansion of this superfamily, with Cluster I and II mainly attributed to tandem  and segmental duplication, respectively. With microarray data of 33 tissue  samples covering the entire life cycle of rice, fairly high OsCESA gene  expression and rather variable OsCSL expression were observed. While some members  from each CSL family (A1, C9, D2, E1, F6 and H1) were expressed in all tissues  examined, many of OsCSL genes were expressed in specific tissues (stamen and  radicles). The expression pattern of OsCESA/CSL and OsBC1L which extensively  co-expressed with OsCESA/CSL can be divided into three major groups with ten  subgroups, each showing a distinct co-expression in tissues representing  typically distinct cell wall constitutions. In particular, OsCESA1, -3 & -8 and  OsCESA4, -7 & -9 were strongly co-expressed in tissues typical of primary and  secondary cell walls, suggesting that they form as a cellulose synthase complex;  these results are similar to the findings in Arabidopsis. OsCESA5/OsCESA6 is  likely partially redundant with OsCESA3 for OsCESA complex organization in the  specific tissues (plumule and radicle). Moreover, the phylogenetic comparison in  rice, Arabidopsis and other species can provide clues for the prediction of  orthologous gene expression patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The study characterized the  CESA/CSL of rice using an integrated approach comprised of phylogeny,  transcriptional profiling and co-expression analyses. These investigations  revealed very useful clues on the major roles of CESA/CSL, their potentially  functional complement and their associations for appropriate cell wall synthesis  in higher plants.\n",

            "The CESA1 component of cellulose synthase is phosphorylated at sites clustered in  two hypervariable regions of the protein. Mutations of the phosphorylated  residues to Ala (A) or Glu (E) alter anisotropic cell expansion and cellulose  synthesis in rapidly expanding roots and hypocotyls. Expression of T166E, S686E,  or S688E mutants of CESA1 fully rescued the temperature sensitive cesA1-1 allele  (rsw1) at a restrictive temperature whereas mutations to A at these positions  caused defects in anisotropic cell expansion. However, mutations to E at residues  surrounding T166 (i.e., S162, T165, and S167) caused opposite effects. Live-cell  imaging of fluorescently labeled CESA showed close correlations between tissue or  cell morphology and patterns of bidirectional motility of CESA complexes in the  plasma membrane. In the WT, CESA complexes moved at similar velocities in both  directions along microtubule tracks. By contrast, the rate of movement of CESA  particles was directionally asymmetric in mutant lines that exhibited abnormal  tissue or cell expansion, and the asymmetry was removed upon depolymerizing  microtubules with oryzalin. This suggests that phosphorylation of CESA  differentially affects a polar interaction with microtubules that may regulate  the length or quantity of a subset of cellulose microfibrils and that this, in  turn, alters microfibril structure in the primary cell wall resulting in or  contributing to the observed defect in anisotropic cell expansion.\n",

There are broad similarities in predicted 3D  structures of the family 48 modules from CESA, from several glycogen- and  starch-binding enzymes, and from protein kinases, but there are substitutions at  some residues thought to be involved in ligand binding. The module in G. monilis  CESA will be on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane so that it could  potentially bind either low molecular weight ligands or starch which is cytosolic  rather than inside membrane-bound plastids in red algae. Possible reasons why red  algal CESAs have evolved family 48 modules perhaps as part of a system to  regulate cellulose synthase activity in relation to cellular carbohydrate status  are briefly discussed.\n",

These genes all encode the domain of unknown function 231 (DUF231). TBR  and its homolog TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE3 (TBL3) are transcriptionally  coordinated with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) genes, and loss of TBR or TBL3 results  in decreased levels of crystalline secondary wall cellulose in trichomes and  stems, respectively. Loss of TBR or TBL3 further results in increased pectin  methylesterase (PME) activity and reduced pectin esterification in etiolated  Arabidopsis hypocotyls. Together, the results suggest that DUF231 proteins might  function in the maintenance of pectin- and probably homogalacturonan  esterification, and that this is a requirement for normal secondary wall  cellulose synthesis, at least in some tissues and organs. Here we expand the  discussion about the role of TBL/DUF231 proteins in cell wall biology based on  sequence and structure analyses. Our analysis revealed structural similarities of  TBR with a rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase (RGAE) of Aspergillus aculeatus and  the protein LUSTRIN A-LIKE (Oryza sativa).

            "Abstract Through exploring potential analogies between cotton seed trichomes (or  cotton fiber) and arabidopsis shoot trichomes we discovered that CesAs from  either the primary or secondary wall phylogenetic clades can support secondary  wall thickening. CesA genes that typically support primary wall synthesis,  AtCesA1,2,3,5, and 6, underpin expansion and secondary wall thickening of  arabidopsis shoot trichomes. In contrast, apparent orthologs of CesA genes that  support secondary wall synthesis in arabidopsis xylem, AtCesA4,7, and 8, are  up-regulated for cotton fiber secondary wall deposition. These conclusions arose  from: (a) analyzing the expression of CesA genes in arabidopsis shoot trichomes;  (b) observing birefringent secondary walls in arabidopsis shoot trichomes with  mutations in AtCesA4, 7, or 8; (c) assaying up-regulated genes during different  stages of cotton fiber development; and (d) comparing genes that were  co-expressed with primary or secondary wall CesAs in arabidopsis with genes  up-regulated in arabidopsis trichomes, arabidopsis secondary xylem, or cotton  fiber during primary or secondary wall deposition. Cumulatively, the data show  that: (a) the xylem of arabidopsis provides the best model for secondary wall  cellulose synthesis in cotton fiber; and (b) CesA genes within a \"cell wall  toolbox\" are used in diverse ways for the construction of particular specialized  cell walls.\n",

            "Mutations in LACERATA (LCR), FIDDLEHEAD (FDH), and BODYGUARD (BDG) cause a  complex developmental syndrome that is consistent with an important role for  these Arabidopsis genes in cuticle biogenesis. The genesis of their pleiotropic  phenotypes is, however, poorly understood. We provide evidence that neither  distorted depositions of cutin, nor deficiencies in the chemical composition of  cuticular lipids, account for these features, instead suggesting that the mutants  alleviate the functional disorder of the cuticle by reinforcing their defenses.  To better understand how plants adapt to these mutations, we performed a  genome-wide gene expression analysis. We found that apparent compensatory  transcriptional responses in these mutants involve the induction of wax, cutin,  cell wall, and defense genes. To gain greater insight into the mechanism by which  cuticular mutations trigger this response in the plants, we performed an overlap  meta-analysis, which is termed MASTA (MicroArray overlap Search Tool and  Analysis), of differentially expressed genes. This suggested that different cell  integrity pathways are recruited in cesA cellulose synthase and cuticular  mutants. Using MASTA for an in silico suppressor/enhancer screen, we identified  SERRATE (SE), which encodes a protein of RNA-processing multi-protein complexes,  as a likely enhancer. In confirmation of this notion, the se lcr and se bdg  double mutants eradicate severe leaf deformations as well as the organ fusions  that are typical of lcr and bdg and other cuticular mutants. Also, lcr does not  confer resistance to Botrytis cinerea in a se mutant background. We propose that  there is a role for SERRATE-mediated RNA signaling in the cuticle integrity  pathway.\n",

As studies in the flowering plant Arabidopsis have suggested  synthesis of the (1,4)-beta-glucan backbone of xyloglucan (XyG), a wall  polysaccharide that tethers adjacent cellulose microfibrils to each other, as a  probable function for the CSLCs, CSLC function was investigated in barley  (Hordeum vulgare L.), a species with low amounts of XyG in its walls. Four barley  CSLC genes were identified (designated HvCSLC1-4). Phylogenetic analysis reveals  three well supported clades of CSLCs in flowering plants, with barley having  representatives in two of these clades. The four barley CSLCs were expressed in  various tissues, with in situ PCR detecting transcripts in all cell types of the  coleoptile and root, including cells with primary and secondary cell walls.  Co-expression analysis showed that HvCSLC3 was coordinately expressed with  putative XyG xylosyltransferase genes. Both immuno-EM and membrane fractionation  showed that HvCSLC2 was located in the plasma membrane of barley  suspension-cultured cells and was not in internal membranes such as endoplasmic  reticulum or Golgi apparatus. Based on our current knowledge of the sub-cellular  locations of polysaccharide synthesis, we conclude that the CSLC family probably  contains more than one type of polysaccharide synthase.\n",

Homozygous seedlings of than germinate and grow but do not  survive. In contrast to other CesA mutants, heterozygous plants are dwarfed and  display a radially swollen root phenotype. Cellulose content is reduced by  approximately one-fifth in heterozygous and by two-fifths in homozygous plants,  showing gene-dosage dependence. Map-based cloning revealed an amino acid  substitution (P578S) in the catalytic domain of the AtCesA3 gene, indicating a  critical role for this residue in the structure and function of the cellulose  synthase complex. Ab initio analysis of the AtCesA3 subdomain flanking the  conserved proline residue predicted that the amino acid substitution to serine  alters protein secondary structure in the catalytic domain. Gene dosage-dependent  expression of the AtCesA3 mutant gene in wild-type A. thaliana plants resulted in  a than dominant-negative phenotype.

Here we provide evidence that cortical microtubules also  position the delivery of CESA complexes to the plasma membrane and interact with  small CESA-containing compartments by a mechanism that permits motility driven by  microtubule depolymerization. The association of CESA compartments with cortical  microtubules was greatly enhanced during osmotic stress and other treatments that  limit cellulose synthesis. On recovery from osmotic stress, delivery of CESA  complexes to the plasma membrane was observed in association with  microtubule-tethered compartments.

This view is confirmed by the  results obtained from new chemical, molecular, and microscopic analyses of  Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with thaxtomin A. Cell wall analysis shows  that thaxtomin A reduces crystalline cellulose, and increases pectins and  hemicellulose in the cell wall. Treatment with thaxtomin A also changes the  expression of genes involved in primary and secondary cellulose synthesis as well  as genes associated with pectin metabolism and cell wall remodelling, in a manner  nearly identical to isoxaben. In addition, it induces the expression of several  defence-related genes and leads to callose deposition. Defects in cellulose  synthesis cause ectopic lignification phenotypes in A. thaliana, and it is shown  that lignification is also triggered by thaxtomin A, although in a pattern  different from isoxaben. Spinning disc confocal microscopy further reveals that  thaxtomin A depletes cellulose synthase complexes from the plasma membrane and  results in the accumulation of these particles in a small microtubule-associated  compartment.

Despite its importance, this goal remains elusive. The work  described here utilizes epitope tagging of cellulose synthase A (CESA) proteins  that are known components of the CSC. To avoid problems associated with  preferential purification of CESA monomers, we developed a strategy based on dual  epitope tagging of the CESA7 protein to select for CESA multimers. With this  approach, we used a two-step purification that preferentially selected for larger  CESA oligomers. These preparations consisted solely of the three known secondary  cell wall CESA proteins CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. No additional CESA isoforms or  other proteins were identified. The data are consistent with a model in which  CESA protein homodimerization occurs prior to formation of larger CESA oligomers.  This suggests that the three different CESA proteins undergo dimerization  independently, but the presence of all three subunits is required for higher  order oligomerization. Analysis of purified CESA complex and crude extracts  suggests that disulfide bonds and noncovalent interactions contribute to the  stability of the CESA subunit interactions.

            "The Zinnia elegans cell culture system is a robust and physiologically relevant  in vitro system for the study of xylem formation. Freshly isolated mesophyll  cells of Zinnia can be hormonally induced to semisynchronously transdifferentiate  into tracheary elements (TEs). Although the system has proven to be valuable, its  utility is diminished by the lack of an efficient transformation protocol. We  herein present a novel method to introduce DNA/RNA efficiently into Zinnia cells  by electroporation-based transient transformation. Using reporter gene plasmids,  we optimized the system for efficiency of transformation and ability for the  transformed cells to transdifferentiate into TEs. Optimal conditions included a  partial digestion of the cell walls by pectolyase, a low voltage and high  capacitance electrical pulse and an optimal medium to maintain cell viability  during transformation. Beyond the simple expression of a reporter protein in  Zinnia cells, we extended our protocol to subcellular protein targeting,  simultaneous co-expression of several reporter proteins and promoter-activity  monitoring during TE differentiation. Most importantly, we tested the system for  double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced RNA silencing. By introducing in  vitro-synthesized dsRNAs, we were able to phenocopy the Arabidopsis cellulose  synthase (CesA) mutants that had defects in secondary cell-wall synthesis.  Suppressing the expression ofZinnia CesA homologues resulted in an increase of  abnormal TEs with aberrant secondary walls. Our electroporation-based transient  transformation protocol provides the suite of tools long required for functional  analysis and developmental studies at single cell levels.\n",

            "In all land plants, cellulose is synthesized from hexameric plasma membrane  complexes. Indirect evidence suggests that in vascular plants the complexes  involved in primary wall synthesis contain three distinct cellulose synthase  catalytic subunits (CESAs). In this study, we show that CESA3 and CESA6 fused to  GFP are expressed in the same cells and at the same time in the hypocotyl of  etiolated seedlings and migrate with comparable velocities along linear  trajectories at the cell surface. We also show that CESA3 and CESA6 can be  coimmunoprecipitated from detergent-solubilized extracts, their protein levels  decrease in mutants for either CESA3, CESA6, or CESA1 and CESA3, CESA6 and also  CESA1 can physically interact in vivo as shown by bimolecular fluorescence  complementation. We also demonstrate that CESA6-related CESA5 and CESA2 are  partially, but not completely, redundant with CESA6 and most likely compete with  CESA6 for the same position in the cellulose synthesis complex. Using  promoter-beta-glucuronidase fusions we show that CESA5, CESA6, and CESA2 have  distinct overlapping expression patterns in hypocotyl and root corresponding to  different stages of cellular development. Together, these data provide evidence  for the existence of binding sites for three distinct CESA subunits in primary  wall cellulose synthase complexes, with two positions being invariably occupied  by CESA1 and CESA3, whereas at least three isoforms compete for the third  position. Participation of the latter three isoforms might fine-tune the CESA  complexes for the deposition of microfibrils at distinct cellular growth stages.\n",

However, phenotypes associated with mutations  in two of these genes, CESA1 and -6, suggest unequal contribution by the  different CESAs to overall enzymatic activity of the complex. We present evidence  that the primary complex requires three unique types of components, CESA1-,  CESA3-, and CESA6-related, for activity. Removal of any of these components  results in gametophytic lethality due to pollen defects, demonstrating that  primary-wall cellulose synthesis is necessary for pollen development.

            "Morlin (7-ethoxy-4-methyl chromen-2-one) was discovered in a screen of 20,000  compounds for small molecules that cause altered cell morphology resulting in  swollen root phenotype in Arabidopsis. Live-cell imaging of fluorescently labeled  cellulose synthase (CESA) and microtubules showed that morlin acts on the  cortical microtubules and alters the movement of CESA. Morlin caused a novel  syndrome of cytoskeletal defects, characterized by cortical array reorientation  and compromised rates of both microtubule elongation and shrinking. Formation of  shorter and more bundled microtubules and detachment from the cell membrane  resulted when GFP::MAP4-MBP was used to visualize microtubules during morlin  treatment. Cytoskeletal effects were accompanied by a reduction in the velocity  and redistribution of CESA complexes labeled with YFP::CESA6 at the cell cortex.  Morlin caused no inhibition of mouse myoblast, bacterial or fungal cell  proliferation at concentrations that inhibit plant cell growth. By contrast,  morlin stimulated microtubule disassembly in cultured hippocampal neurons but had  no significant effect on cell viability. Thus, morlin appears to be a useful new  probe of the mechanisms that regulate microtubule cortical array organization and  its functional interaction with CESA.\n",

            "Cellulose is synthesized by cellulose synthases (CESAs) contained in plasma  membrane-localized complexes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, three types of CESA  subunits (CESA4/IRREGULAR XYLEM5 [IRX5], CESA7/IRX3, and CESA8/IRX1) are required  for secondary cell wall formation. We report that mutations in these proteins  conferred enhanced resistance to the soil-borne bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum  and the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina. By contrast,  susceptibility to these pathogens was not altered in cell wall mutants of primary  wall CESA subunits (CESA1, CESA3/ISOXABEN RESISTANT1 [IXR1], and CESA6/IXR2) or  POWDERY MILDEW-RESISTANT5 (PMR5) and PMR6 genes. Double mutants indicated that  irx-mediated resistance was independent of salicylic acid, ethylene, and  jasmonate signaling. Comparative transcriptomic analyses identified a set of  common irx upregulated genes, including a number of abscisic acid  (ABA)-responsive, defense-related genes encoding antibiotic peptides and enzymes  involved in the synthesis and activation of antimicrobial secondary metabolites.  These data as well as the increased susceptibility of ABA mutants (abi1-1,  abi2-1, and aba1-6) to R. solanacearum support a direct role of ABA in resistance  to this pathogen. Our results also indicate that alteration of secondary cell  wall integrity by inhibiting cellulose synthesis leads to specific activation of  novel defense pathways that contribute to the generation of an  antimicrobial-enriched environment hostile to pathogens.\n",

            "The CESA gene superfamily of Arabidopsis and other seed plants comprises the CESA  family, which encodes the catalytic subunits of cellulose synthase, and eight  families of CESA-like (CSL) genes whose functions are largely unknown. The CSL  genes have been proposed to encode processive beta-glycosyl transferases that  synthesize noncellulosic cell wall polysaccharides. BLAST searches of EST and  shotgun genomic sequences from the moss Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) B.S.G. were  used to identify genes with high similarity to vascular plant CESAs, CSLAs,  CSLCs, and CSLDs. However, searches using Arabidopsis CSLBs, CSLEs, and CSLGs or  rice CSLFs or CSLHs as queries identified no additional CESA superfamily members  in P. patens, indicating that this moss lacks representatives of these families.  Intron insertion sites are highly conserved between Arabidopsis and P. patens in  all four shared gene families. However, phylogenetic analysis strongly supports  independent diversification of the shared families in mosses and vascular plants.  The lack of orthologs of vascular plant CESAs in the P. patens genome indicates  that the divergence of mosses and vascular plants predated divergence and  specialization of CESAs for primary and secondary cell wall syntheses and for  distinct roles within the rosette terminal complexes. In contrast to Arabidopsis,  the CSLD family is highly represented among P. patens ESTs. This is consistent  with the proposed function of CSLDs in tip growth and the central role of tip  growth in the development of the moss protonema.\n",

            "CesA1 and CesA3 are thought to occupy noninterchangeable sites in the cellulose  synthase making primary wall cellulose in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.  Heynh). With domain swaps and deletions, we show that sites C terminal to  transmembrane domain 2 give CesAs access to their individual sites and, from  dominance and recessive behavior, deduce that certain CesA alleles exclude others  from accessing each site. Constructs that swapped or deleted N-terminal domains  were stably transformed into the wild type and into the temperature-sensitive  mutants rsw1 (Ala-549Val in CesA1) and rsw5 (Pro-1056Ser in CesA3).  Dominant-positive behavior was assayed as root elongation at the restrictive  temperature and dominant-negative effects were observed at the permissive  temperature. A protein with the catalytic and C-terminal domains of CesA1 and the  N-terminal domain of CesA3 promoted growth only in rsw1 consistent with it  accessing the CesA1 site even though it contained the CesA3 N-terminal domain. A  protein having the CesA3 catalytic and C-terminal domains linked to the CesA1  N-terminal domain dramatically affected growth, but only in the CesA3 mutant.  This is consistent with the operation of the same access rule taking this  chimeric protein to the CesA3 site. In this case, however, the transgene behaved  as a genotype-specific dominant negative, causing a 60% death rate in rsw5, but  giving no visible phenotype in wild type or rsw1. We therefore hypothesize that  possession of CesA3(WT) protects Columbia and rsw1 from the lethal effects of  this chimeric protein, whereas the mutant protein (CesA3(rsw5)) does not.\n",

            "Stems and branches of angiosperm trees form tension wood (TW) when exposed to a  gravitational stimulus. One of the main characteristics of TW, which  distinguishes it from normal wood, is the formation of fibers with a thick inner  gelatinous cell wall layer mainly composed of crystalline cellulose. Hence TW is  enriched in cellulose, and deficient in lignin and hemicelluloses. An expressed  sequence tag library made from TW-forming tissues in Populus tremula (L.) x  tremuloides (Michx.) and data from transcript profiling using microarray and  metabolite analysis were obtained during TW formation in Populus tremula (L.) in  two growing seasons. The data were examined with the aim of identifying the genes  responsible for the change in carbon (C) flow into various cell wall components,  and the mechanisms important for the formation of the gelatinous cell wall layer  (G-layer). A specific effort was made to identify carbohydrate-active enzymes  with a putative function in cell wall biosynthesis. An increased C flux to  cellulose was suggested by a higher abundance of sucrose synthase transcripts.  However, genes related to the cellulose biosynthetic machinery were not generally  affected, although the expression of secondary wall-specific CesA genes was  modified in both directions. Other pathways for which the data suggested  increased activity included lipid and glucosamine biosynthesis and the pectin  degradation machinery. In addition, transcripts encoding fasciclin-like  arabinogalactan proteins were particularly increased and found to lack true  Arabidopsis orthologs. Major pathways for which the transcriptome and metabolome  analysis suggested decreased activity were the pathway for C flux through  guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) sugars to mannans, the pentose phosphate pathway,  lignin biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of cell wall matrix carbohydrates.

However, the  molecular basis of such cellulose heterogeneity has so far remained unclear.  Since enrichment of better-quality cellulose, in terms of increased degree of  polymerization and crystallinity, is one of the goals of forest biotechnology,  our main objective is to decipher the roles of distinct cellulose synthase (CesA)  genes in tree development, with special reference to wood production. Here, we  report two full-length CesA cDNAs, PtrCesA3 and PtrCesA4, from an economically  important tree aspen (Populus tremuloides). PtrCesA3 is orthologous to the  Arabidopsis AtCesA4 gene involved in secondary wall formation, whereas PtrCesA4  is orthologous to the Arabidopsis AtCesA1 gene involved in primary cell wall  formation. To define the specific cell types expressing these CesA genes, we  explored the natural distribution patterns of PtrCesA3 and PtrCesA4 transcripts  in a variety of aspen organs, such as leaves, petiole, stem, and roots, using in  situ hybridization with hypervariable region-specific antisense riboprobes. Such  a side-by-side comparison suggested that PtrCesA3 is exclusively expressed in  secondary-wall-forming cells of xylem and phloem fibers, whereas PtrCesA4 is  predominantly expressed in primary-wall-forming expanding cells in all aspen  organs examined. These findings suggest a functionally distinct role for each of  these two types of PtrCesAs during primary and secondary wall biogenesis in aspen  trees, and that such functional distinction appears to be conserved between  annual herbaceous plants and perennial trees.\n",

Here, we report on cloning of two new CesA  cDNAs, PtrCesA6 and PtrCesA7 involved in the primary cell wall development in  aspen (Populus tremuloides) trees. Both these distinct cDNAs, isolated from a  developing xylem cDNA library, share only 60-67% identities with each other as  well as with five other previously known aspen CesA cDNAs. Interestingly,  PtrCESA6 from aspen, a dicot species, shares maximum identity of 81-84% with  three CESA isoforms from maize and rice, two monocot species. On the other hand,  PtrCESA7 shares a maximum identity of 86% with AtCESA2, a primary wall-related  CesA member from Arabidopsis, a dicot species. Gene expression analyses by  reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) suggested that both  these genes are expressed at a low level in all aspen tissues examined but  PtrCesA7 is expressed at a higher level than PtrCesA6. While corroborating these  results, in situ mRNA hybridization studies using three different aspen organs  also suggested that PtrCesA6 and PtrCesA7 genes are expressed in all expanding  cells depositing primary cell wall but PtrCesA7 is expressed at a higher level  than PtrCesA6. These differential gene expression profiles suggest that each of  these CesAs may be playing a specific role during primary cell wall development  in aspen trees.

            "Genetic improvement of cell wall polymer synthesis in forest trees is one of the  major goals of forest biotechnology that could possibly impact their end product  utilization. Identification of genes involved in cell wall polymer biogenesis is  essential for achieving this goal. Among various candidate cell wall-related  genes, cellulose synthase-like D (CSLD) genes are intriguing due to their  hitherto unknown functions in cell wall polymer synthesis but strong structural  similarity with cellulose synthases (CesAs) involved in cellulose deposition.  Little is known about CSLD genes from trees. In the present article PtrCSLD2, a  first CSLD gene from an economically important tree, aspen (Populus tremuloides)  is reported. PtrCSLD2 cDNA was isolated from an aspen xylem cDNA library and  encodes a protein that shares 90% similarity with Arabidopsis AtCSLD3 protein  involved in root hair tip growth. It is possible that xylem fibers that also grow  by intrusive tip growth may need expression of PtrCSLD2 for controlling the  length of xylem fibers, a wood quality trait of great economical importance.  PtrCSLD2 protein has a N-terminal cysteine-rich putative zinc-binding domain;  eight transmembrane domains; alternating conserved and hypervariable domains; and  a processive glycosyltransferases signature, D, D, D, QXXRW; all similar to aspen  CesA proteins. However, PtrCSLD2 shares only 43-48% overall identity with the  known aspen CesAs suggesting its distinct functional role in cell wall polymer  synthesis perhaps other than cellulose biosynthesis. Based on Southern analysis,  the aspen CSLD gene family consists of at least three genes and this gene copy  estimate is supported by phylogenetic analysis of available CSLDs from plants.  Moreover, gene expression studies using RT-PCR and in situ mRNA hybridization  showed that PtrCSLD2 is expressed at a low level in all aspen tissues examined  with a slightly higher expression level in secondary cell wall-enriched aspen  xylem as compared to primary cell wall enriched tissues. Together, these  observations suggest that PtrCSLD2 gene may be involved in the synthesis of  matrix polysaccharides that are dominant in secondary cell walls of poplar xylem.  Future molecular genetic analyses will clarify the functional significance of  CSLD genes in the development of woody trees.\n",

            "Recent molecular genetic data suggest that cellulose synthase (CesA) genes coding  for the enzymes that catalyze cellulose biosynthesis (CESAs) in Arabidopsis and  other herbaceous plants belong to a large gene family. Much less is known about  CesA genes from forest trees. To isolate new CesA genes from tree species,  discriminative but easily obtainable homologous DNA probes are required.  Hypervariable regions (HVRII) of CesA genes represent highly divergent DNA  sequences that can be used to examine structural, expressional and functional  relationships among CesA genes. We used a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR)-based technique to identify HVRII regions from eight types of  CesA genes and two types of CesA-like D (CslD) genes in quaking aspen (Populus  tremuloides Michx.). Comparison of these aspen CESA/CSLD HVRII regions with the  predicted proteins from eight full-length CesA/CslD cDNAs available in our  laboratory and with searches for aspen CesA/CslD homologs in the recently  released Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray. genome confirmed the utility of  this approach in identifying several CesA/CslD gene members from the Populus  genome. Phylogenetic analysis of 56 HVRII domains from a variety of plant species  suggested that at least six distinct classes of CESAs exist in plants, supporting  a previous proposal for renaming HVRII regions as class-specific regions (CSR).  This method of CSR cloning could be applied to other crop plants and tree  species, especially softwoods, for which the whole genome sequence is unlikely to  become available in the near future because of the large size of these genomes.\n",

            "Sequence data from cDNA and genomic clones, coupled with analyses of expressed  sequence tag databases, indicate that the CesA (cellulose synthase) gene family  from barley (Hordeum vulgare) has at least eight members, which are distributed  across the genome. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction has been used to  determine the relative abundance of mRNA transcripts for individual HvCesA genes  in vegetative and floral tissues, at different stages of development. To ensure  accurate expression profiling, geometric averaging of multiple internal control  gene transcripts has been applied for the normalization of transcript abundance.  Total HvCesA mRNA levels are highest in coleoptiles, roots, and stems and much  lower in floral tissues, early developing grain, and in the elongation zone of  leaves. In most tissues, HvCesA1, HvCesA2, and HvCesA6 predominate, and their  relative abundance is very similar; these genes appear to be coordinately  transcribed. A second group, comprising HvCesA4, HvCesA7, and HvCesA8, also  appears to be coordinately transcribed, most obviously in maturing stem and root  tissues. The HvCesA3 expression pattern does not fall into either of these two  groups, and HvCesA5 transcript levels are extremely low in all tissues. Thus, the  HvCesA genes fall into two general groups of three genes with respect to mRNA  abundance, and the co-expression of the groups identifies their products as  candidates for the rosettes that are involved in cellulose biosynthesis at the  plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis allows the two groups of genes to be  linked with orthologous Arabidopsis CesA genes that have been implicated in  primary and secondary wall synthesis.\n",

We show here that the genes responsible for three distinct brittle  mutations of rice, induced by the insertion of the endogenous retrotransposon  Tos17, correspond to CesA (cellulose synthase catalytic subunit) genes, OsCesA4,  OsCesA7 and OsCesA9. Three CesA genes were expressed in seedlings, culms,  premature panicles, and roots but not in mature leaves, and the expression  profiles were almost identical among the three genes. Cellulose contents were  dramatically decreased (8.9%-25.5% of the wild-type level) in the culms of null  mutants of the three genes, indicating that these genes are not functionally  redundant. Consistent with these results, cell walls in the cortical fiber cells  were shown to be thinner in all the mutants than in wild-type plants.

In young vessels, these  three proteins localize within the cell, whereas in older vessels, all three CesA  proteins colocalize with bands of cortical microtubules that mark the sites of  secondary cell wall deposition. In the absence of one subunit, however, the  remaining two subunits are retained in the cell, demonstrating that all three  CesA proteins are required to assemble a functional complex. CesA proteins with  altered catalytic activity localize normally, suggesting that cellulose synthase  activity is not required for this localization. Cortical microtubule arrays are  required continually to maintain normal CesA protein localization. By contrast,  actin microfilaments do not colocalize with the CesA proteins and are unlikely to  play a direct role in their localization.

            "Cellulose synthase catalytic subunits (CesAs) have been implicated in catalyzing  the biosynthesis of cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls.  Interactions between CesA subunits are thought to be required for normal  cellulose synthesis, which suggests that incorporation of defective CesA subunits  into cellulose synthase complex could potentially cause a dominant effect on  cellulose synthesis. However, all CesA mutants so far reported have been shown to  be recessive in terms of cellulose synthesis. In the course of studying the  molecular mechanisms regulating secondary wall formation in fibers, we have found  that a mutant allele of AtCesA7 gene in the fra5 (fragile fiber 5) mutant causes  a semidominant phenotype in the reduction of fiber cell wall thickness and  cellulose content. The fra5 missense mutation occurred in a conserved amino acid  located in the second cytoplasmic domain of AtCesA7. Overexpression of the fra5  mutant cDNA in wild-type plants not only reduced secondary wall thickness and  cellulose content but also decreased primary wall thickness and cell elongation.  In contrast, overexpression of the fra6 mutant form of AtCesA8 did not cause any  reduction in cell wall thickness and cellulose content. These results suggest  that the fra5 mutant protein may interfere with the function of endogenous  wild-type CesA proteins, thus resulting in a dominant negative effect on  cellulose biosynthesis.\n",

            "Genetic improvement of cellulose biosynthesis in woody trees is one of the major  goals of tree biotechnology research. Yet, progress in this field has been slow  owing to (1) unavailability of key genes from tree genomes, (2) the inability to  isolate active and intact cellulose synthase complexes and, (3) the limited  understanding of the mechanistic processes involved in the wood cellulose  development. Here I report on the recent advances in molecular genetics of  cellulose synthases (CesA) from aspen trees. Two different types of cellulose  synthases appear to be involved in cellulose deposition in primary and secondary  walls in aspen xylem. The three distinct secondary CesAs from aspen- PtrCesA1,  PtrCesA2, and PtrCesA3-appear to be aspen homologs of Arabidopsis secondary CesAs  AtCesA8, AtCesA7, and AtCesA4, respectively, based on their high  identity/similarity (>80%). These aspen CesA proteins share the transmembrane  domain (TMD) structure that is typical of all known \"true\" CesA proteins: two  TMDs toward the N-terminal and six TMDs toward the C-terminal. The putative  catalytic domain is present between TMDs 2 and 3. All signature motifs of  processive glycosyltransferases are also present in this catalytic domain. In a  phylogenetic tree based on various predicted CesA proteins from Arabidopsis and  aspen, aspen CesAs fall into families similar to those seen with Arabidopsis  CesAs, suggesting their functional similarity. The coordinate expression of three  aspen secondary CesAs in xylem and phloem fibers, along with their simultaneous  tension stress-responsive upregulation, suggests that these three CesAs may play  a pivotal role in biosynthesis of better-quality cellulose in secondary cell  walls of plants. These results are likely to have a direct impact on genetic  manipulation of trees in the future.\n",

We show that the eli1 mutants occur  in the cellulose synthase gene CESA3 in Arabidopsis thaliana and cause reduced  cellulose synthesis, providing further evidence for the function of multiple CESA  subunits in cellulose synthesis. We show that reduced levels of cellulose  synthesis, caused by mutations in cellulose synthase genes and in genes affecting  cell expansion, activate lignin synthesis and defense responses through jasmonate  and ethylene and other signaling pathways.

Here,  we report that only four of 10 CESA genes, CESA1, CESA2, CESA3, and CESA9 are  significantly expressed in the Arabidopsis embryo. We further identified two new  mutations in the RADIALLY SWOLLEN1 (RSW1/CESA1) gene of Arabidopsis that obstruct  organized growth in both shoot and root and interfere with cell division and cell  expansion already in embryogenesis. One mutation is expected to completely  abolish the enzymatic activity of RSW1(CESA1) because it eliminated one of three  conserved Asp residues, which are considered essential for  beta-glycosyltransferase activity. In this presumed null mutant, primary cell  walls are still being formed, but are thin, highly undulated, and frequently  interrupted. From the heart-stage onward, cell elongation in the embryo axis is  severely impaired, and cell width is disproportionally increased. In the embryo,  CESA1, CESA2, CESA3, and CESA9 are expressed in largely overlapping domains and  may act cooperatively in higher order complexes.

Seed plants and bacteria differ in  the structures of their membrane terminal complexes that make cellulose and, in  turn, control the dimensions of the microfibrils produced. They also differ in  the domain structures of their CesA gene products (the catalytic subunit of  cellulose synthase), which have been localized to terminal complexes and appear  to help maintain terminal complex structure. Terminal complex structures in algae  range from rosettes (plant-like) to linear forms (bacterium-like). Thus, algal  CesA genes may reveal domains that control terminal complex assembly and  microfibril structure. The CesA genes from the alga Mesotaenium caldariorum, a  member of the order Zygnematales, which have rosette terminal complexes, are  remarkably similar to seed plant CesAs, with deduced amino acid sequence  identities of up to 59%. In addition to the putative transmembrane helices and  the D-D-D-QXXRW motif shared by all known CesA gene products, M. caldariorum and  seed plant CesAs share a region conserved among plants, an N-terminal  zinc-binding domain, and a variable or class-specific region. This indicates that  the domains that characterize seed plant CesAs arose prior to the evolution of  land plants and may play a role in maintaining the structures of rosette terminal  complexes.

The predicted PtrCesA2 protein shows a high degree of identity/similarity  (87%/91%) to the predicted gene product of Arabidopsis AtCesA7 gene that has been  associated with secondary cell wall development. Previously, a mutation in  AtCesA7 gene (irx3) was correlated with a significant decrease in the amount of  cellulose synthesized (about 70%) and genetic complementation of irx3 mutant with  a wild-type AtCesA7 gene restored the normal phenotype. This is the first report  of a full-length AtCesA7 ortholog from any non-Arabidopsis species.  Interestingly, PtrCesA2 shares only 64% identity with our earlier reported  PtrCesA1 from aspen suggesting its structural distinctness from the only other  known CesA member from the aspen genome. PtrCesA1 is a xylem-specific and tension  stress responsive gene that is highly similar to another Arabidopsis gene,  AtCesA8 which also has been associated with secondary wall development. Moreover,  AtCesA7 and AtCesA8 are suggested to be part of the same cellulose synthase  complex. Isolation of PtrCesA2 from a xylem library enriched in cells with active  secondary wall synthesis, PtrCesA2 expression levels similar to PtrCesA1 and high  similarity of PtrCesA1 and PtrCesA2 to AtCesA8 and AtCesA7, respectively, suggest  that both these aspen genes might be involved in the secondary wall development  in aspen woody tissues.

We show that this  domain in GhCesA1 can bind two atoms of Zn2+, as predicted by its structure.  Analysis in the yeast two-hybrid system indicates that the N-terminal portions of  cotton fiber GhCesA1 and GhCesA2 containing these domains can interact to form  homo- or heterodimers. Although Zn(2+) binding occurs only when the protein is in  the reduced form, biochemical analyses show that under oxidative conditions, the  GhCesA1 zinc-finger domain and also the full-length protein dimerize via  intermolecular disulfide bonds, indicating CesA dimerization can be regulated by  redox state. We also provide evidence that the herbicide CGA 325'615 (Syngenta,  Basel), which inhibits synthesis of crystalline cellulose and leads to a  disruption of rosette architecture, may affect the oxidative state of the  zinc-finger domain that is necessary for rosette stability.

The antisense  phenotypes of CesA1 and CesA3 were closely similar and correlated with reduced  expression of the target gene. Reductions in cell length rather than cell number  underlay the shorter bolts and stamen filaments. Surprisingly, seedling roots  were unaffected in both CesA1 and CesA3 antisense plants. In keeping with the  mild phenotype compared with Rsw1(-), reductions in total cellulose levels in  antisense CesA1 and CesA3 plants were at the borderline of significance. We  conclude that CesA3, like CesA1, is required for deposition of primary wall  cellulose. To test whether there were important functional differences between  the two, we overexpressed CesA3 in rsw1 but were unable to complement that  mutant's defect in CesA1. The function of CesA2 was less obvious, but, consistent  with a role in primary wall deposition, the rate of stem elongation was reduced  in antisense plants growing rapidly at 31 degrees C.\n",

            "The plant cell wall is a complex structure consisting of a variety of polymers  including cellulose, xyloglucan, xylan and polygalacturonan. Biochemical and  genetic analysis has made it possible to clone genes encoding cellulose synthases  (CesA). A comparison of the predicted protein sequences in the Arabidopsis genome  indicates that 30 divergent genes with similarity to CesAs exist. It is possible  that these cellulose synthase-like (Csl) proteins do not contribute to cellulose  synthesis, but rather to the synthesis of other wall polymers. A major challenge  is, therefore, to assign biological function to these genes. In an effort to  address this issue we have systematically identified T-DNA or transposon  insertions in 17 Arabidopsis Csls. Phenotypic characterization of \"knock-out\"  mutants includes the determination of spectroscopic profile differences in mutant  cell walls from wild-type plants by Fourier-transform IR microscopy. A more  precise characterization includes cell wall fractionation followed by neutral  sugar composition analysis by anionic exchange chromatography.\n",

            "Isoxaben is a pre-emergence herbicide that inhibits cellulose biosynthesis in  higher plants. Two loci identified by isoxaben-resistant mutants (ixr1-1, ixr1-2,  and ixr2-1) in Arabidopsis have been reported previously. IXR1 was recently shown  to encode the cellulose synthase catalytic subunit CESA3 (W.-R. Scheible, R.  Eshed, T. Richmond, D. Delmer, and C. Somerville [2001] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  98: 10079-10084). Here, we report on the cloning of IXR2, and show that it  encodes another cellulose synthase isoform, CESA6. ixr2-1 carries a mutation  substituting an amino acid close to the C terminus of CESA6 that is highly  conserved among CESA family members. Transformation of wild-type plants with the  mutated gene and not with the wild-type gene conferred increased resistance  against the herbicide. The simplest interpretation for the existence of these two  isoxaben-resistant loci is that CESA3 and CESA6 have redundant functions.  However, loss of function procuste1 alleles of CESA6 were previously shown to  have a strong growth defect and reduced cellulose content in roots and dark-grown  hypocotyls. This indicates that in these mutants, the presence of CESA3 does not  compensate for the absence of CESA6 in roots and dark-grown hypocotyls, which  argues against redundant functions for CESA3 and CESA6. Together, these  observations are compatible with a model in which CESA6 and CESA3 are active as a  protein complex.\n",

            "Although cellulose biosynthesis among the cyanobacteria has been suggested  previously, we present the first conclusive evidence, to our knowledge, of the  presence of cellulose in these organisms. Based on the results of x-ray  diffraction, electron microscopy of microfibrils, and cellobiohydrolase I-gold  labeling, we report the occurrence of cellulose biosynthesis in nine species  representing three of the five sections of cyanobacteria. Sequence analysis of  the genomes of four cyanobacteria revealed the presence of multiple amino acid  sequences bearing the DDD35QXXRW motif conserved in all cellulose synthases.  Pairwise alignments demonstrated that CesAs from plants were more similar to  putative cellulose synthases from Anabaena sp. Pasteur Culture Collection 7120  and Nostoc punctiforme American Type Culture Collection 29133 than any other  cellulose synthases in the database. Multiple alignments of putative cellulose  synthases from Anabaena sp. Pasteur Culture Collection 7120 and N. punctiforme  American Type Culture Collection 29133 with the cellulose synthases of other  prokaryotes, Arabidopsis, Gossypium hirsutum, Populus alba x Populus tremula,  corn (Zea mays), and Dictyostelium discoideum showed that cyanobacteria share an  insertion between conserved regions U1 and U2 found previously only in eukaryotic  sequences. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the cyanobacterial  cellulose synthases share a common branch with CesAs of vascular plants in a  manner similar to the relationship observed with cyanobacterial and chloroplast  16s rRNAs, implying endosymbiotic transfer of CesA from cyanobacteria to plants  and an ancient origin for cellulose synthase in eukaryotes.\n",

            "Cellulose synthase genes (CesAs) encode a broad range of processive  glycosyltransferases that synthesize (1-->4)beta-D-glycosyl units. The proteins  predicted to be encoded by these genes contain up to eight membrane-spanning  domains and four 'U-motifs' with conserved aspartate residues and a QxxRW motif  that are essential for substrate binding and catalysis. In higher plants, the  domain structure includes two plant-specific regions, one that is relatively  conserved and a second, so-called 'hypervariable region' (HVR). Analysis of the  phylogenetic relationships among members of the CesA multi-gene families from two  grass species, Oryza sativa and Zea mays, with Arabidopsis thaliana and other  dicotyledonous species reveals that the CesA genes cluster into several distinct  sub-classes. Whereas some sub-classes are populated by CesAs from all species,  two sub-classes are populated solely by CesAs from grass species. The sub-class  identity is primarily defined by the HVR, and the sequence in this region does  not vary substantially among members of the same sub-class. Hence, we suggest  that the region is more aptly termed a 'class-specific region' (CSR). Several  motifs containing cysteine, basic, acidic and aromatic residues indicate that the  CSR may function in substrate binding specificity and catalysis. Similar motifs  are conserved in bacterial cellulose synthases, the Dictyostelium discoideum  cellulose synthase, and other processive glycosyltransferases involved in the  synthesis of non-cellulosic polymers with (1-->4)beta-linked backbones, including  chitin, heparan, and hyaluronan. These analyses re-open the question whether all  the CesA genes encode cellulose synthases or whether some of the sub-class  members may encode other non-cellulosic (1-->4)beta-glycan synthases in plants.  For example, the mixed-linkage (1-->3)(1-->4)beta-D-glucan synthase is found  specifically in grasses and possesses many features more similar to those of  cellulose synthase than to those of other beta-linked cross-linking glycans. In  this respect, the enzymatic properties of the mixed-linkage beta-glucan synthases  not only provide special insight into the mechanisms of (1-->4)beta-glycan  synthesis but may also uncover the genes that encode the synthases themselves.\n",

            "While there is an ever-increasing amount of information regarding cellulose  synthase catalytic subunits (CesA) and their role in the formation of the cell  wall, the remainder of the enzymes that synthesize structural cell wall  polysaccharides are unknown. The completion of the Arabidopsis genome and the  wealth of the sequence information from other plant genome projects provide a  rich resource for determining the identity of these enzymes. Arabidopsis contains  six families of genes related to cellulose synthase, the cellulose synthase-like  (Csl) genes. Our laboratory is taking a multidisciplinary approach to determine  the function of the Csl genes, incorporating genomic, genetic and biochemical  data. Information from expressed sequence tag (EST) projects has revealed the  presence of Csl genes in all plant species with a significant number of ESTs.  Certain Csl families appear to be missing from some species. For example, no  examples of CslG ESTs have been found in rice or maize. Microarray data and  reporter constructs are being used to determine the expression pattern of the  CesA and Csl genes in Arabidopsis. Mutations and insertion events have been  identified in a majority of the genes in the Arabidopsis CesA superfamily and are  being characterized by phenotypic and biochemical analysis. While we cannot yet  link the function of any of the Csl genes to their respective products, the  expression and localization of these genes is consistent with the expected  expression pattern of polysaccharide synthases that contribute to the primary  cell wall.\n",

Semidominant mutations at the IXR1 and IXR2 loci of  Arabidopsis confer isoxaben and thiazolidinone resistance. Isolation of the IXR1  gene by map-based cloning revealed that it encodes the AtCESA3 isoform of  cellulose synthase. The two known mutant alleles contain point mutations that  replace glycine 998 with aspartic acid, and threonine 942 with isoleucine,  respectively. The mutations occur in a highly conserved region of the enzyme near  the carboxyl terminus that is well separated from the proposed active site.

            "Developing cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibers, cultured in vitro with their  associated ovules, were used to compare the effects of two herbicides that  inhibit cellulose synthesis: 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB) and an experimental  thiatriazine-based herbicide, CGA 325'615. CGA 325'615 in nanomolar  concentrations or DCB in micromolar concentrations causes inhibition of synthesis  of crystalline cellulose. Unlike DCB, CGA 325'615 also causes concomitant  accumulation of non-crystalline beta-1,4-glucan that can be at least partially  solubilized from fiber walls with ammonium oxalate. The unusual solubility of  this accumulated glucan may be explained by its strong association with protein.  Treatment of the glucan fraction with protease changes its size distribution and  leads to precipitation of the glucan. Treatment of the glucan fraction with  cellulase digests the glucan and also releases protein that has been  characterized as GhCesA-1 and GhCesA-2--proteins that are believed to represent  the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase. The fact that cellulase treatment is  required to release this protein indicates an extremely tight association of the  glucan with the CesA proteins. In addition, CGA 325'615, but not DCB, also causes  accumulation of CesA protein and a membrane-associated cellulase in the membrane  fraction of fibers. In addition to the effects of CGA 325'615 on levels of both  of these proteins, the level of both also shows coordinate regulation during  fiber development, further suggesting they are both important for cellulose  synthesis. The accumulation of non-crystalline glucan caused by CGA 325'615  mimics the phenotype of the cellulose-deficient rsw1 mutant of Arabidopsis that  also accumulates an apparently similar glucan (T.

Pollen tubes of Nicotiana alata Link et  Otto, an ornamental tobacco, were therefore used to identify genes potentially  encoding catalytic subunits of the callose synthase and cellulose synthase  enzymes. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) with  pollen-tube RNA and primers designed to conserved regions of bacterial and plant  cellulose synthase (CesA) genes amplified a fragment that corresponded to an  abundantly expressed cellulose-synthase-like gene named NaCslD1. A fragment from  a true CesA gene (NaCesA1) was also amplified, but corresponding cDNAs could not  be identified in a pollen-tube library, consistent with the very low level of  expression of the NaCesA1 gene. RT-PCR with pollen-tube RNA and primers designed  to regions conserved between the fungal FKS genes [that encode (1,3)-beta-glucan  synthases] and their presumed plant homologs (the Gsl or glucan-synthase-like  genes) amplified a fragment that corresponded to an abundantly expressed gene  named NaGsl1. A second Gsl gene detected by RT-PCR (NaGsl2) was expressed at low  levels in immature floral organs. The structure of full-length cDNAs of NaCslD1,  NaCesA1, and NaGsl1 are presented. Both NaCslD1 and NaGsl1 are predominantly  expressed in the male gametophyte (developing and mature pollen and growing  pollen tubes), and we propose that they encode the catalytic subunits of two  beta-glucan synthases involved in pollen-tube wall synthesis.

            "CesA genes are believed to encode the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase.  Identification of nine distinct CesA cDNAs from maize (Zea mays) has allowed us  to initiate comparative studies with homologs from Arabidopsis and other plant  species. Mapping studies show that closely related CesA genes are not clustered  but are found at different chromosomal locations in both Arabidopsis and maize.  Furthermore, sequence comparisons among the CesA-deduced proteins show that these  cluster in groups wherein orthologs are often more similar than paralogs,  indicating that different subclasses evolved prior to the divergence of the  monocot and dicot lineages. Studies using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain  reaction with gene-specific primers for six of the nine maize genes indicate that  all genes are expressed to at least some level in all of the organs examined.  However, when expression patterns for a few selected genes from maize and  Arabidopsis were analyzed in more detail, they were found to be expressed in  unique cell types engaged in either primary or secondary wall synthesis. These  studies also indicate that amino acid sequence comparisons, at least in some  cases, may have value for prediction of such patterns of gene expression. Such  analyses begin to provide insights useful for future genetic engineering of  cellulose deposition, in that identification of close orthologs across species  may prove useful for prediction of patterns of gene expression and may also aid  in prediction of mutant combinations that may be necessary to generate severe  phenotypes.\n",
